COUNTESS:
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
BERTRAM:
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
ward, evermore in subjection.
LAFEU:
You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
abundance.
COUNTESS:
What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
LAFEU:
He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
COUNTESS:
This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature
immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
the King's disease.
LAFEU:
How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
COUNTESS:
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
LAFEU:
He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
BERTRAM:
What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
LAFEU:
A fistula, my lord.
BERTRAM:
I heard not of it before.
LAFEU:
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
COUNTESS:
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives
her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
LAFEU:
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
COUNTESS:
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
you affect a sorrow than to have-
HELENA:
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
LAFEU:
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
grief the enemy to the living.
COUNTESS:
If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
soon mortal.
BERTRAM:
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
LAFEU:
How understand we that?
COUNTESS:
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.
LAFEU:
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.
COUNTESS:
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
BERTRAM:
The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
servants to you! Be comfortable to my mother, your
mistress, and make much of her.
LAFEU:
Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
father.
HELENA:
O, were that all! I think not on my father;
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him; my imagination
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
I am undone; there is no living, none,
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it, he is so above me.
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
To see him every hour; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
In our heart's table-heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
That they take place when virtue's steely bones
Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
PAROLLES:
Save you, fair queen!
HELENA:
And you, monarch!
PAROLLES:
No.
HELENA:
And no.
PAROLLES:
Are you meditating on virginity?
HELENA:
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
against him?
PAROLLES:
Keep him out.
HELENA:
But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
PAROLLES:
There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
undermine you and blow you up.
HELENA:
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
PAROLLES:
Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown
up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.
HELENA:
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
virgin.
PAROLLES:
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule
of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.
Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly
increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
with't.
HELENA:
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
PAROLLES:
Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time
of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
anything with it?
HELENA:
Not my virginity yet.
There shall your master have a thousand loves,
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
His humble ambition, proud humility,
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
I know not what he shall. God send him well!
The court's a learning-place, and he is one-
PAROLLES:
What one, i' faith?
HELENA:
That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
PAROLLES:
What's pity?
HELENA:
That wishing well had not a body in't
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
Might with effects of them follow our friends
And show what we alone must think, which never
Returns us thanks.
PAGE:
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
PAROLLES:
Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will
think of thee at court.
HELENA:
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
PAROLLES:
Under Mars, I.
HELENA:
I especially think, under Mars.
PAROLLES:
Why under Man?
HELENA:
The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
under Mars.
PAROLLES:
When he was predominant.
HELENA:
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
PAROLLES:
Why think you so?
HELENA:
You go so much backward when you fight.
PAROLLES:
That's for advantage.
HELENA:
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
a good wing, and I like the wear well.
PAROLLES:
I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I
will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else
thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good
husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
HELENA:
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
To show her merit that did miss her love?
The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.
KING:
The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
A braving war.
FIRST LORD:
So 'tis reported, sir.
KING:
Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
With caution, that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business, and would seem
To have us make denial.
FIRST LORD:
His love and wisdom,
Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
For amplest credence.
KING:
He hath arm'd our answer,
And Florence is denied before he comes;
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
To stand on either part.
SECOND LORD:
It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
For breathing and exploit.
KING:
What's he comes here?
FIRST LORD:
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
Young Bertram.
KING:
Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
BERTRAM:
My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
KING:
I would I had that corporal soundness now,
As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership. He did look far
Into the service of the time, and was
Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
But on us both did haggish age steal on,
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
To talk of your good father. In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak, and at this time
His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him
He us'd as creatures of another place;
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
Making them proud of his humility
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times;
Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now
But goers backward.
BERTRAM:
His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.
KING:
Would I were with him! He would always say-
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
This his good melancholy oft began,
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.
I, after him, do after him wish too,
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
To give some labourers room.
SECOND LORD:
You're loved, sir;
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
KING:
I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,
Since the physician at your father's died?
He was much fam'd.
BERTRAM:
Some six months since, my lord.
KING:
If he were living, I would try him yet-
Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
With several applications. Nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
My son's no dearer.
BERTRAM:
Thank your Majesty.
COUNTESS:
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
STEWARD:
Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
when of ourselves we publish them.
COUNTESS:
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my
slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit
them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
CLOWN:
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
COUNTESS:
Well, sir.
CLOWN:
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will
to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
COUNTESS:
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
CLOWN:
I do beg your good will in this case.
COUNTESS:
In what case?
CLOWN:
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'
my body; for they say bames are blessings.
COUNTESS:
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
CLOWN:
My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
COUNTESS:
Is this all your worship's reason?
CLOWN:
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
COUNTESS:
May the world know them?
CLOWN:
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
COUNTESS:
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
CLOWN:
I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for
my wife's sake.
COUNTESS:
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
CLOWN:
Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land
spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his
cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and
blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their
heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
i' th' herd.
COUNTESS:
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
CLOWN:
A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:
COUNTESS:
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
STEWARD:
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
Of her I am to speak.
COUNTESS:
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen
I mean.
CLOWN:
[Sings]
COUNTESS:
What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
CLOWN:
One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'
song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find
no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,
quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man
may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
COUNTESS:
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
CLOWN:
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.
I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
COUNTESS:
Well, now.
STEWARD:
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
COUNTESS:
Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
STEWARD:
Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without
rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she
deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard
virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
something to know it.
COUNTESS:
YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.
Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so
tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor
misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further
anon.
Even so it was with me when I was young.
If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.
By our remembrances of days foregone,
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.
HELENA:
What is your pleasure, madam?
COUNTESS:
You know, Helen,
I am a mother to you.
HELENA:
Mine honourable mistress.
COUNTESS:
Nay, a mother.
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'
That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
Yet I express to you a mother's care.
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
That this distempered messenger of wet,
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
Why, that you are my daughter?
HELENA:
That I am not.
COUNTESS:
I say I am your mother.
HELENA:
Pardon, madam.
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
I am from humble, he from honoured name;
No note upon my parents, his all noble.
My master, my dear lord he is; and I
His servant live, and will his vassal die.
He must not be my brother.
COUNTESS:
Nor I your mother?
HELENA:
You are my mother, madam; would you were-
So that my lord your son were not my brother-
Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
I care no more for than I do for heaven,
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
COUNTESS:
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?
My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see
The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross
You love my son; invention is asham'd,
Against the proclamation of thy passion,
To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
That in their kind they speak it; only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
To tell me truly.
HELENA:
Good madam, pardon me.
COUNTESS:
Do you love my son?
HELENA:
Your pardon, noble mistress.
COUNTESS:
Love you my son?
HELENA:
Do not you love him, madam?
COUNTESS:
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
The state of your affection; for your passions
Have to the full appeach'd.
HELENA:
Then I confess,
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
That before you, and next unto high heaven,
I love your son.
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
Be not offended, for it hurts not him
That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
By any token of presumptuous suit,
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
Yet never know how that desert should be.
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love,
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
Religious in mine error, I adore
The sun that looks upon his worshipper
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
Let not your hate encounter with my love,
For loving where you do; but if yourself,
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
To her whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
That seeks not to find that her search implies,
But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
COUNTESS:
Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
To go to Paris?
HELENA:
Madam, I had.
COUNTESS:
Wherefore? Tell true.
HELENA:
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
You know my father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
And manifest experience had collected
For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
The King is render'd lost.
COUNTESS:
This was your motive
For Paris, was it? Speak.
HELENA:
My lord your son made me to think of this,
Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then.
COUNTESS:
But think you, Helen,
If you should tender your supposed aid,
He would receive it? He and his physicians
Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off
The danger to itself?
HELENA:
There's something in't
More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
Of his profession, that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
By such a day and hour.
COUNTESS:
Dost thou believe't?
HELENA:
Ay, madam, knowingly.
COUNTESS:
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.
KING:
Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
And is enough for both.
FIRST LORD:
'Tis our hope, sir,
After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
And find your Grace in health.
KING:
No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
Will not confess he owes the malady
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
Whether I live or die, be you the sons
Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
Those bated that inherit but the fall
Of the last monarchy-see that you come
Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.
SECOND LORD:
Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
KING:
Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
They say our French lack language to deny,
If they demand; beware of being captives
Before you serve.
BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
KING:
Farewell. Come hither to me.
FIRST LORD:
O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
PAROLLES:
'Tis not his fault, the spark.
SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!
PAROLLES:
Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
BERTRAM:
I am commanded here and kept a coil with
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
PAROLLES:
An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
BERTRAM:
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.
FIRST LORD:
There's honour in the theft.
PAROLLES:
Commit it, Count.
SECOND LORD:
I am your accessary; and so farewell.
BERTRAM:
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
FIRST LORD:
Farewell, Captain.
SECOND LORD:
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
PAROLLES:
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
FIRST LORD:
We shall, noble Captain.
PAROLLES:
Mars dote on you for his novices!
What will ye do?
BERTRAM:
Stay; the King!
PAROLLES:
Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
dilated farewell.
BERTRAM:
And I will do so.
PAROLLES:
Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
LAFEU:
[Kneeling]
KING:
I'll fee thee to stand up.
LAFEU:
Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
KING:
I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
And ask'd thee mercy for't.
LAFEU:
Good faith, across!
But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
Of your infirmity?
KING:
No.
LAFEU:
O, will you eat
No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
And write to her a love-line.
KING:
What her is this?
LAFEU:
Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.
KING:
Now, good Lafeu,
Bring in the admiration, that we with the
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
LAFEU:
Nay, I'll fit you,
And not be all day neither.
KING:
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
LAFEU:
Nay, come your ways.
KING:
This haste hath wings indeed.
LAFEU:
Nay, come your ways;
This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,
That dare leave two together. Fare you well.
KING:
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
HELENA:
Ay, my good lord.
Gerard de Narbon was my father,
In what he did profess, well found.
KING:
I knew him.
HELENA:
The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
And of his old experience th' only darling,
He bade me store up as a triple eye,
Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
I come to tender it, and my appliance,
With all bound humbleness.
KING:
We thank you, maiden;
But may not be so credulous of cure,
When our most learned doctors leave us, and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
To prostitute our past-cure malady
To empirics; or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit to esteem
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
HELENA:
My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
I will no more enforce mine office on you;
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one to bear me back again.
KING:
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
As one near death to those that wish him live.
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
HELENA:
What I can do can do no hurt to try,
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister.
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
From simple sources, and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
Where most it promises; and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
KING:
I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
HELENA:
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
It is not so with Him that all things knows,
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor, that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim;
But know I think, and think I know most sure,
My art is not past power nor you past cure.
KING:
Art thou so confident? Within what space
Hop'st thou my cure?
HELENA:
The greatest Grace lending grace.
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
KING:
Upon thy certainty and confidence
What dar'st thou venture?
HELENA:
Tax of impudence,
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name
Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended
With vilest torture let my life be ended.
KING:
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak;
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense, sense saves another way.
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
That happiness and prime can happy call.
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
That ministers thine own death if I die.
HELENA:
If I break time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;
And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
But, if I help, what do you promise me?
KING:
Make thy demand.
HELENA:
But will you make it even?
KING:
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
HELENA:
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command.
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
KING:
Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
More should I question thee, and more I must,
Though more to know could not be more to trust,
From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
COUNTESS:
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
breeding.
CLOWN:
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
business is but to the court.
COUNTESS:
To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
CLOWN:
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's
cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,
nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for
the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
COUNTESS:
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
CLOWN:
It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
COUNTESS:
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
CLOWN:
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's
mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
COUNTESS:
Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
questions?
CLOWN:
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
any question.
COUNTESS:
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
all demands.
CLOWN:
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
COUNTESS:
To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,
are you a courtier?
CLOWN:
O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
hundred of them.
COUNTESS:
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
CLOWN:
O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.
COUNTESS:
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
CLOWN:
O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
COUNTESS:
You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
CLOWN:
O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
COUNTESS:
Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were
but bound to't.
CLOWN:
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
COUNTESS:
I play the noble housewife with the time,
To entertain it so merrily with a fool.
CLOWN:
O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
COUNTESS:
An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back;
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
CLOWN:
Not much commendation to them?
COUNTESS:
Not much employment for you. You understand me?
CLOWN:
Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
COUNTESS:
Haste you again.
LAFEU:
They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear.
PAROLLES:
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
out in our latter times.
BERTRAM:
And so 'tis.
LAFEU:
To be relinquish'd of the artists-
PAROLLES:
So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
LAFEU:
Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
PAROLLES:
Right; so I say.
LAFEU:
That gave him out incurable-
PAROLLES:
Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
LAFEU:
Not to be help'd-
PAROLLES:
Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
LAFEU:
Uncertain life and sure death.
PAROLLES:
Just; you say well; so would I have said.
LAFEU:
I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
PAROLLES:
It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall
read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
LAFEU:
[Reading the ballad title]
Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
PAROLLES:
That's it; I would have said the very same.
LAFEU:
Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
respect-
PAROLLES:
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief
and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
will not acknowledge it to be the-
LAFEU:
Very hand of heaven.
PAROLLES:
Ay; so I say.
LAFEU:
In a most weak-
PAROLLES:
And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;
which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
LAFEU:
Generally thankful.
PAROLLES:
I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
LAFEU:
Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
coranto.
PAROLLES:
Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
LAFEU:
'Fore God, I think so.
KING:
Go, call before me all the lords in court.
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
Which but attends thy naming.
Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
I have to use. Thy frank election make;
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
HELENA:
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
LAFEU:
I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
And writ as little beard.
KING:
Peruse them well.
Not one of those but had a noble father.
HELENA:
Gentlemen,
Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.
ALL:
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
HELENA:
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
That I protest I simply am a maid.
Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
We'll ne'er come there again.'
KING:
Make choice and see:
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
HELENA:
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
FIRST LORD:
And grant it.
HELENA:
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
LAFEU:
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
life.
HELENA:
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
SECOND LORD:
No better, if you please.
HELENA:
My wish receive,
Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
LAFEU:
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
HELENA:
Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.
Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
LAFEU:
These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
HELENA:
You are too young, too happy, and too good,
To make yourself a son out of my blood.
FOURTH LORD:
Fair one, I think not so.
LAFEU:
There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
thee already.
HELENA:
[To BERTRAM]
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
Into your guiding power. This is the man.
KING:
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
BERTRAM:
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.
KING:
Know'st thou not, Bertram,
What she has done for me?
BERTRAM:
Yes, my good lord;
But never hope to know why I should marry her.
KING:
Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
BERTRAM:
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!
KING:
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
The place is dignified by the doer's deed;
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
The property by what it is should go,
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she's immediate heir;
And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
Which challenges itself as honour's born
And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,
Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
I can create the rest. Virtue and she
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
BERTRAM:
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
KING:
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
HELENA:
That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
Let the rest go.
KING:
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream
We, poising us in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
BERTRAM:
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.
KING:
Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
BERTRAM:
I take her hand.
KING:
Good fortune and the favour of the King
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
LAFEU:
Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
PAROLLES:
Your pleasure, sir?
LAFEU:
Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
PAROLLES:
Recantation! My Lord! my master!
LAFEU:
Ay; is it not a language I speak?
PAROLLES:
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
succeeding. My master!
LAFEU:
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
PAROLLES:
To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
LAFEU:
To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
PAROLLES:
You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
old.
LAFEU:
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
cannot bring thee.
PAROLLES:
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
LAFEU:
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
worth.
PAROLLES:
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
LAFEU:
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
PAROLLES:
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
LAFEU:
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
PAROLLES:
I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
LAFEU:
Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
a scruple.
PAROLLES:
Well, I shall be wiser.
LAFEU:
Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
PAROLLES:
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
LAFEU:
I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
age will give me leave.
PAROLLES:
Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.
LAFEU:
Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
you; you have a new mistress.
PAROLLES:
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve
above is my master.
LAFEU:
Who? God?
PAROLLES:
Ay, sir.
LAFEU:
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat
thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
themselves upon thee.
PAROLLES:
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
LAFEU:
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
PAROLLES:
Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
be conceal'd awhile.
BERTRAM:
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
PAROLLES:
What's the matter, sweetheart?
BERTRAM:
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
I will not bed her.
PAROLLES:
What, what, sweetheart?
BERTRAM:
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
PAROLLES:
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
BERTRAM:
There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
not yet.
PAROLLES:
Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
He wears his honour in a box unseen
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
Therefore, to th' war!
BERTRAM:
It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
That which I durst not speak. His present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.
PAROLLES:
Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
BERTRAM:
Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
PAROLLES:
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.
HELENA:
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
CLOWN:
She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very
well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
HELENA:
If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
well?
CLOWN:
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
HELENA:
What two things?
CLOWN:
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!
PAROLLES:
Bless you, my fortunate lady!
HELENA:
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
fortunes.
PAROLLES:
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,
have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
CLOWN:
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
did as you say.
PAROLLES:
Why, I say nothing.
CLOWN:
Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know
nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
title, which is within a very little of nothing.
PAROLLES:
Away! th'art a knave.
CLOWN:
You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
PAROLLES:
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
CLOWN:
Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
laughter.
PAROLLES:
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
Madam, my lord will go away to-night:
A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
Which they distil now in the curbed time,
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim.
HELENA:
What's his else?
PAROLLES:
That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
Strength'ned with what apology you think
May make it probable need.
HELENA:
What more commands he?
PAROLLES:
That, having this obtain'd, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.
HELENA:
In everything I wait upon his will.
PAROLLES:
I shall report it so.
HELENA:
I pray you.
Come, sirrah.
LAFEU:
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
BERTRAM:
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
LAFEU:
You have it from his own deliverance.
BERTRAM:
And by other warranted testimony.
LAFEU:
Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
BERTRAM:
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
and accordingly valiant.
LAFEU:
I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
make us friends; I will pursue the amity
PAROLLES:
[To BERTRAM]
LAFEU:
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
PAROLLES:
Sir!
LAFEU:
O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
very good tailor.
BERTRAM:
[Aside to PAROLLES]
PAROLLES:
She is.
BERTRAM:
Will she away to-night?
PAROLLES:
As you'll have her.
BERTRAM:
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.
LAFEU:
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
God save you, Captain.
BERTRAM:
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
PAROLLES:
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
displeasure.
LAFEU:
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
BERTRAM:
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
LAFEU:
And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
must do good against evil.
PAROLLES:
An idle lord, I swear.
BERTRAM:
I think so.
PAROLLES:
Why, do you not know him?
BERTRAM:
Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
HELENA:
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.
BERTRAM:
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
That presently you take your way for home,
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
For my respects are better than they seem,
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not. This to my mother.
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
I leave you to your wisdom.
HELENA:
Sir, I can nothing say
But that I am your most obedient servant.
BERTRAM:
Come, come, no more of that.
HELENA:
And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
To equal my great fortune.
BERTRAM:
Let that go.
My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.
HELENA:
Pray, sir, your pardon.
BERTRAM:
Well, what would you say?
HELENA:
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own.
BERTRAM:
What would you have?
HELENA:
Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
Faith, yes:
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
BERTRAM:
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
HELENA:
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
BERTRAM:
Where are my other men, monsieur?
Farewell!
Go thou toward home, where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.
PAROLLES:
Bravely, coragio!
DUKE:
So that, from point to point, now have you hear
The fundamental reasons of this war;
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.
FIRST LORD:
Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.
DUKE:
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.
SECOND LORD:
Good my lord,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
But like a common and an outward man
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess'd.
DUKE:
Be it his pleasure.
FIRST LORD:
But I am sure the younger of our nature,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.
DUKE:
Welcome shall they be
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell.
To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.
COUNTESS:
It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he
comes not along with her.
CLOWN:
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
man.
COUNTESS:
By what observance, I pray you?
CLOWN:
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a
man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
song.
COUNTESS:
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
CLOWN:
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling
and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
COUNTESS:
What have we here?
CLOWN:
E'en that you have there.
COUNTESS:
[Reads]
recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded
her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run
away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
To fly the favours of so good a king,
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.
CLOWN:
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
and my young lady.
COUNTESS:
What is the -matter?
CLOWN:
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.
COUNTESS:
Why should he be kill'd?
CLOWN:
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
part, I only hear your son was run away.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Save you, good madam.
HELENA:
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Do not say so.
COUNTESS:
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Thither we bend again.
HELENA:
Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I
write a "never."
This is a dreadful sentence.
COUNTESS:
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Ay, madam;
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
COUNTESS:
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Ay, madam.
COUNTESS:
And to be a soldier?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.
COUNTESS:
Return you thither?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
HELENA:
[Reads]
'Tis bitter.
COUNTESS:
Find you that there?
HELENA:
Ay, madam.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
his heart was not consenting to.
COUNTESS:
Nothing in France until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
A servant only, and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known.
COUNTESS:
Parolles, was it not?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Ay, my good lady, he.
COUNTESS:
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Indeed, good lady,
The fellow has a deal of that too much
Which holds him much to have.
COUNTESS:
Y'are welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.
COUNTESS:
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near?
HELENA:
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
Nothing in France until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
That chase thee from thy country, and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
And though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected. Better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
My being here it is that holds thee hence.
Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house,
And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
That pitiful rumour may report my flight
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
DUKE:
The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.
BERTRAM:
Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To th' extreme edge of hazard.
DUKE:
Then go thou forth;
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!
BERTRAM:
This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.
COUNTESS:
Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
Might you not know she would do as she has done
By sending me a letter? Read it again.
STEWARD:
[Reads]
Ambitious love hath so in me offended
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
His taken labours bid him me forgive;
I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
He is too good and fair for death and me;
Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'
COUNTESS:
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented.
STEWARD:
Pardon me, madam;
If I had given you this at over-night,
She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
Pursuit would be but vain.
COUNTESS:
What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife;
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
When haply he shall hear that she is gone
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
WIDOW:
Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose
all the sight.
DIANA:
They say the French count has done most honourable service.
WIDOW:
It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;
and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you
may know by their trumpets.
MARIANA:
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
honesty.
WIDOW:
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
gentleman his companion.
MARIANA:
I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of
them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a
maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that
so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that
threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
DIANA:
You shall not need to fear me.
WIDOW:
I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.
God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
HELENA:
To Saint Jaques le Grand.
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
WIDOW:
At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
HELENA:
Is this the way?
WIDOW:
Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
But till the troops come by,
I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
The rather for I think I know your hostess
As ample as myself.
HELENA:
Is it yourself?
WIDOW:
If you shall please so, pilgrim.
HELENA:
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
WIDOW:
You came, I think, from France?
HELENA:
I did so.
WIDOW:
Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service.
HELENA:
His name, I pray you.
DIANA:
The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
HELENA:
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
His face I know not.
DIANA:
What some'er he is,
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
As 'tis reported, for the King had married him
Against his liking. Think you it is so?
HELENA:
Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
DIANA:
There is a gentleman that serves the Count
Reports but coarsely of her.
HELENA:
What's his name?
DIANA:
Monsieur Parolles.
HELENA:
O, I believe with him,
In argument of praise, or to the worth
Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
To have her name repeated; all her deserving
Is a reserved honesty, and that
I have not heard examin'd.
DIANA:
Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord.
WIDOW:
I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is
Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
HELENA:
How do you mean?
May be the amorous Count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose.
WIDOW:
He does, indeed;
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
In honestest defence.
Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
MARIANA:
The gods forbid else!
WIDOW:
So, now they come.
That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
That, Escalus.
HELENA:
Which is the Frenchman?
DIANA:
He-
That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?
HELENA:
I like him well.
DIANA:
'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
That leads him to these places; were I his lady
I would poison that vile rascal.
HELENA:
Which is he?
DIANA:
That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
HELENA:
Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
PAROLLES:
Lose our drum! well.
MARIANA:
He's shrewdly vex'd at something.
Look, he has spied us.
WIDOW:
Marry, hang you!
MARIANA:
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
WIDOW:
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
Already at my house.
HELENA:
I humbly thank you.
Please it this matron and this gentle maid
To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking
Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
Worthy the note.
BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.
SECOND LORD:
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
FIRST LORD:
If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more
in your respect.
SECOND LORD:
On my life, my lord, a bubble.
BERTRAM:
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
SECOND LORD:
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
lordship's entertainment.
FIRST LORD:
It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
business in a main danger fail you.
BERTRAM:
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
FIRST LORD:
None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
SECOND LORD:
I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise
him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
judgment in anything.
FIRST LORD:
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom
of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.
SECOND LORD:
O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of
his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
BERTRAM:
How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your
disposition.
FIRST LORD:
A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
PAROLLES:
But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
FIRST LORD:
That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
have prevented, if he had been there to command.
BERTRAM:
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
be recovered.
PAROLLES:
It might have been recovered.
BERTRAM:
It might, but it is not now.
PAROLLES:
It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have
that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
BERTRAM:
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think
your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you
speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
syllable of our worthiness.
PAROLLES:
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
BERTRAM:
But you must not now slumber in it.
PAROLLES:
I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen
down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further
from me.
BERTRAM:
May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
PAROLLES:
I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
attempt I vow.
BERTRAM:
I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,
will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
PAROLLES:
I love not many words.
SECOND LORD:
No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
FIRST LORD:
You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is
that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
you have him ever after.
BERTRAM:
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
so seriously he does address himself unto?
SECOND LORD:
None in the world; but return with an invention, and
clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost
emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
not for your lordship's respect.
FIRST LORD:
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you
shall see this very night.
SECOND LORD:
I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
BERTRAM:
Your brother, he shall go along with me.
SECOND LORD:
As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.
BERTRAM:
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
The lass I spoke of.
FIRST LORD:
But you say she's honest.
BERTRAM:
That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
Will you go see her?
FIRST LORD:
With all my heart, my lord.
HELENA:
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
I know not how I shall assure you further
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
WIDOW:
Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act.
HELENA:
Nor would I wish you.
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
Err in bestowing it.
WIDOW:
I should believe you;
For you have show'd me that which well approves
Y'are great in fortune.
HELENA:
Take this purse of gold,
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
Which I will over-pay and pay again
When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
Now his important blood will nought deny
That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
Howe'er repented after.
WIDOW:
Now I see
The bottom of your purpose.
HELENA:
You see it lawful then. It is no more
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
Herself most chastely absent. After this,
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
To what is pass'd already.
WIDOW:
I have yielded.
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
As if his life lay on 't.
HELENA:
Why then to-night
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
But let's about it.
SECOND LORD:
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;
though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must
not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we
must produce for an interpreter.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
SECOND LORD:
Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
FIRST SOLDIER:
No, sir, I warrant you.
SECOND LORD:
But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
FIRST SOLDIER:
E'en such as you speak to me.
SECOND LORD:
He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must
seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two
hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
PAROLLES:
Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time
enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a
very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;
and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my
tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
tongue.
SECOND LORD:
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
guilty of.
PAROLLES:
What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I
dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put
you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
SECOND LORD:
Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
he is?
PAROLLES:
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,
or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
SECOND LORD:
We cannot afford you so.
PAROLLES:
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
stratagem.
SECOND LORD:
'Twould not do.
PAROLLES:
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
SECOND LORD:
Hardly serve.
PAROLLES:
Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
SECOND LORD:
How deep?
PAROLLES:
Thirty fathom.
SECOND LORD:
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
PAROLLES:
I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I
recover'd it.
SECOND LORD:
You shall hear one anon.
PAROLLES:
A drum now of the enemy's!
SECOND LORD:
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
ALL:
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
PAROLLES:
O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Boskos thromuldo boskos.
PAROLLES:
I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
And I shall lose my life for want of language.
If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
Italian, or French, let him speak to me;
I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
PAROLLES:
O!
FIRST SOLDIER:
O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
SECOND LORD:
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
FIRST SOLDIER:
The General is content to spare thee yet;
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life.
PAROLLES:
O, let me live,
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
Which you will wonder at.
FIRST SOLDIER:
But wilt thou faithfully?
PAROLLES:
If I do not, damn me.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Acordo linta.
Come on; thou art granted space.
SECOND LORD:
Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
Till we do hear from them.
SECOND SOLDIER:
Captain, I will.
SECOND LORD:
'A will betray us all unto ourselves-
Inform on that.
SECOND SOLDIER:
So I will, sir.
SECOND LORD:
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
BERTRAM:
They told me that your name was Fontibell.
DIANA:
No, my good lord, Diana.
BERTRAM:
Titled goddess;
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
You are no maiden, but a monument;
When you are dead, you should be such a one
As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.
DIANA:
She then was honest.
BERTRAM:
So should you be.
DIANA:
No.
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
As you owe to your wife.
BERTRAM:
No more o'that!
I prithee do not strive against my vows.
I was compell'd to her; but I love the
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service.
DIANA:
Ay, so you serve us
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
And mock us with our bareness.
BERTRAM:
How have I sworn!
DIANA:
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
To swear by him whom I protest to love
That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
At least in my opinion.
BERTRAM:
Change it, change it;
Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever.
DIANA:
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
BERTRAM:
I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
To give it from me.
DIANA:
Will you not, my lord?
BERTRAM:
It is an honour 'longing to our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
In me to lose.
DIANA:
Mine honour's such a ring:
My chastity's the jewel of our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part
Against your vain assault.
BERTRAM:
Here, take my ring;
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
And I'll be bid by thee.
DIANA:
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
BERTRAM:
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
DIANA:
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end
PHILO:
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.
Look where they come!
Take but good note, and you shall see in him
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
CLEOPATRA:
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
ANTONY:
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
CLEOPATRA:
I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
ANTONY:
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
MESSENGER:
News, my good lord, from Rome.
ANTONY:
Grates me the sum.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, hear them, Antony.
Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
ANTONY:
How, my love?
CLEOPATRA:
Perchance? Nay, and most like,
You must not stay here longer; your dismission
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
ANTONY:
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
Is to do thus , when such a mutual pair
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.
CLEOPATRA:
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
Will be himself.
ANTONY:
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
CLEOPATRA:
Hear the ambassadors.
ANTONY:
Fie, wrangling queen!
Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
To weep; whose every passion fully strives
To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
No messenger but thine, and all alone
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.
DEMETRIUS:
Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
PHILO:
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.
DEMETRIUS:
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
CHARMIAN:
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
charge his horns with garlands!
ALEXAS:
Soothsayer!
SOOTHSAYER:
Your will?
CHARMIAN:
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
SOOTHSAYER:
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
ALEXAS:
Show him your hand.
ENOBARBUS:
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.
CHARMIAN:
Good, sir, give me good fortune.
SOOTHSAYER:
I make not, but foresee.
CHARMIAN:
Pray, then, foresee me one.
SOOTHSAYER:
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
CHARMIAN:
He means in flesh.
IRAS:
No, you shall paint when you are old.
CHARMIAN:
Wrinkles forbid!
ALEXAS:
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
CHARMIAN:
Hush!
SOOTHSAYER:
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
CHARMIAN:
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
ALEXAS:
Nay, hear him.
CHARMIAN:
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
SOOTHSAYER:
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
CHARMIAN:
O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
SOOTHSAYER:
You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
CHARMIAN:
Then belike my children shall have no names.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
SOOTHSAYER:
If every of your wishes had a womb,
And fertile every wish, a million.
CHARMIAN:
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
ALEXAS:
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
CHARMIAN:
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
ALEXAS:
We'll know all our fortunes.
ENOBARBUS:
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
drunk to bed.
IRAS:
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
CHARMIAN:
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
IRAS:
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
CHARMIAN:
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
SOOTHSAYER:
Your fortunes are alike.
IRAS:
But how, but how? Give me particulars.
SOOTHSAYER:
I have said.
IRAS:
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
CHARMIAN:
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
where would you choose it?
IRAS:
Not in my husband's nose.
CHARMIAN:
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
Isis, I beseech thee!
IRAS:
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
CHARMIAN:
Amen.
ALEXAS:
Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!
ENOBARBUS:
Hush! Here comes Antony.
CHARMIAN:
Not he; the Queen.
CLEOPATRA:
Saw you my lord?
ENOBARBUS:
No, lady.
CLEOPATRA:
Was he not here?
CHARMIAN:
No, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
ENOBARBUS:
Madam?
CLEOPATRA:
Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
ALEXAS:
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
CLEOPATRA:
We will not look upon him. Go with us.
MESSENGER:
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
ANTONY:
Against my brother Lucius?
MESSENGER:
Ay.
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
Whose better issue in the war from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them.
ANTONY:
Well, what worst?
MESSENGER:
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
ANTONY:
When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.
MESSENGER:
Labienus-
This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
Extended Asia from Euphrates,
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia,
Whilst-
ANTONY:
Antony, thou wouldst say.
MESSENGER:
O, my lord!
ANTONY:
Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
MESSENGER:
At your noble pleasure.
ANTONY:
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
FIRST ATTENDANT:
The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
SECOND ATTENDANT:
He stays upon your will.
ANTONY:
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.
What are you?
SECOND MESSENGER:
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
ANTONY:
Where died she?
SECOND MESSENGER:
In Sicyon.
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know, this bears.
ANTONY:
Forbear me.
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
What our contempts doth often hurl from us
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution low'ring, does become
The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off.
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!
ENOBARBUS:
What's your pleasure, sir?
ANTONY:
I must with haste from hence.
ENOBARBUS:
Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
word.
ANTONY:
I must be gone.
ENOBARBUS:
Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
celerity in dying.
ANTONY:
She is cunning past man's thought.
ENOBARBUS:
Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
ANTONY:
Would I had never seen her!
ENOBARBUS:
O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
your travel.
ANTONY:
Fulvia is dead.
ENOBARBUS:
Sir?
ANTONY:
Fulvia is dead.
ENOBARBUS:
Fulvia?
ANTONY:
Dead.
ENOBARBUS:
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
ANTONY:
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
ENOBARBUS:
And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
on your abode.
ANTONY:
No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.
ENOBARBUS:
I shall do't.
CLEOPATRA:
Where is he?
CHARMIAN:
I did not see him since.
CLEOPATRA:
See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
I did not send you. If you find him sad,
Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.
CHARMIAN:
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
CLEOPATRA:
What should I do I do not?
CHARMIAN:
In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
CHARMIAN:
Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.
CLEOPATRA:
I am sick and sullen.
ANTONY:
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
CLEOPATRA:
Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
Will not sustain it.
ANTONY:
Now, my dearest queen-
CLEOPATRA:
Pray you, stand farther from me.
ANTONY:
What's the matter?
CLEOPATRA:
I know by that same eye there's some good news.
What says the married woman? You may go.
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
I have no power upon you; hers you are.
ANTONY:
The gods best know-
CLEOPATRA:
O, never was there queen
So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.
ANTONY:
Cleopatra-
CLEOPATRA:
Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!
ANTONY:
Most sweet queen-
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
Then was the time for words. No going then!
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Art turn'd the greatest liar.
ANTONY:
How now, lady!
CLEOPATRA:
I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.
ANTONY:
Hear me, queen:
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile; but my full heart
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
By any desperate change. My more particular,
And that which most with you should safe my going,
Is Fulvia's death.
CLEOPATRA:
Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
ANTONY:
She's dead, my Queen.
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
See when and where she died.
CLEOPATRA:
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.
ANTONY:
Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
As thou affects.
CLEOPATRA:
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
So Antony loves.
ANTONY:
My precious queen, forbear,
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.
CLEOPATRA:
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
Like perfect honour.
ANTONY:
You'll heat my blood; no more.
CLEOPATRA:
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
ANTONY:
Now, by my sword-
CLEOPATRA:
And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe.
ANTONY:
I'll leave you, lady.
CLEOPATRA:
Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
That you know well. Something it is I would-
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
And I am all forgotten!
ANTONY:
But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
For idleness itself.
CLEOPATRA:
'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!
ANTONY:
Let us go. Come.
Our separation so abides and flies
That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
Away!
CAESAR:
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
Our great competitor. From Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
LEPIDUS:
I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
Than what he chooses.
CAESAR:
You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
No way excuse his foils when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
Call on him for't! But to confound such time
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel to judgment.
LEPIDUS:
Here's more news.
MESSENGER:
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
And it appears he is belov'd of those
That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Give him much wrong'd.
CAESAR:
I should have known no less.
It hath been taught us from the primal state
That he which is was wish'd until he were;
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
To rot itself with motion.
MESSENGER:
Caesar, I bring thee word
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.
CAESAR:
Antony,
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Which some did die to look on. And all this-
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
So much as lank'd not.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis pity of him.
CAESAR:
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.
LEPIDUS:
To-morrow, Caesar,
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
CAESAR:
Till which encounter
It is my business too. Farewell.
LEPIDUS:
Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
To let me be partaker.
CAESAR:
Doubt not, sir;
I knew it for my bond.
CLEOPATRA:
Charmian!
CHARMIAN:
Madam?
CLEOPATRA:
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.
CHARMIAN:
Why, madam?
CLEOPATRA:
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.
CHARMIAN:
You think of him too much.
CLEOPATRA:
O, 'tis treason!
CHARMIAN:
Madam, I trust, not so.
CLEOPATRA:
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
MARDIAN:
What's your Highness' pleasure?
CLEOPATRA:
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
MARDIAN:
Yes, gracious madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Indeed?
MARDIAN:
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done.
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars.
CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian,
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.
ALEXAS:
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
CLEOPATRA:
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
ALEXAS:
Last thing he did, dear Queen,
He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
CLEOPATRA:
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
ALEXAS:
'Good friend,' quoth he
'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb'd by him.
CLEOPATRA:
What, was he sad or merry?
ALEXAS:
Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
CLEOPATRA:
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
ALEXAS:
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?
CLEOPATRA:
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?
CHARMIAN:
O that brave Caesar!
CLEOPATRA:
Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
Say 'the brave Antony.'
CHARMIAN:
The valiant Caesar!
CLEOPATRA:
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.
CHARMIAN:
By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.
CLEOPATRA:
My salad days,
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
To say as I said then. But come, away!
Get me ink and paper.
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
POMPEY:
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men.
MENECRATES:
Know, worthy Pompey,
That what they do delay they not deny.
POMPEY:
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
The thing we sue for.
MENECRATES:
We, ignorant of ourselves,
Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
POMPEY:
I shall do well.
The people love me, and the sea is mine;
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
Nor either cares for him.
MENAS:
Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
POMPEY:
Where have you this? 'Tis false.
MENAS:
From Silvius, sir.
POMPEY:
He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Even till a Lethe'd dullness-
How now, Varrius!
VARRIUS:
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
A space for farther travel.
POMPEY:
I could have given less matter
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
For such a petty war; his soldiership
Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
The higher our opinion, that our stirring
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
MENAS:
I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
Not mov'd by Antony.
POMPEY:
I know not, Menas,
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
Were't not that we stand up against them all,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
May cement their divisions, and bind up
The petty difference we yet not know.
Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Come, Menas.
LEPIDUS:
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech.
ENOBARBUS:
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
Let Antony look over Caesar's head
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
I would not shave't to-day.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis not a time
For private stomaching.
ENOBARBUS:
Every time
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
LEPIDUS:
But small to greater matters must give way.
ENOBARBUS:
Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS:
Your speech is passion;
But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
The noble Antony.
ENOBARBUS:
And yonder, Caesar.
ANTONY:
If we compose well here, to Parthia.
Hark, Ventidius.
CAESAR:
I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS:
Noble friends,
That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
May it be gently heard. When we debate
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
The rather for I earnestly beseech,
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
Nor curstness grow to th' matter.
ANTONY:
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
I should do thus.
CAESAR:
Welcome to Rome.
ANTONY:
Thank you.
CAESAR:
Sit.
ANTONY:
Sit, sir.
CAESAR:
Nay, then.
ANTONY:
I learn you take things ill which are not so,
Or being, concern you not.
CAESAR:
I must be laugh'd at
If, or for nothing or a little,
Should say myself offended, and with you
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
Once name you derogately when to sound your name
It not concern'd me.
ANTONY:
My being in Egypt, Caesar,
What was't to you?
CAESAR:
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
Might be my question.
ANTONY:
How intend you- practis'd?
CAESAR:
You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me, and their contestation
Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
ANTONY:
You do mistake your business; my brother never
Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
And have my learning from some true reports
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours,
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
As matter whole you have not to make it with,
It must not be with this.
CAESAR:
You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me; but
You patch'd up your excuses.
ANTONY:
Not so, not so;
I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
I would you had her spirit in such another!
The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
ENOBARBUS:
Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
wars with the women!
ANTONY:
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
But say I could not help it.
CAESAR:
I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria; you
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
Did gibe my missive out of audience.
ANTONY:
Sir,
He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
I told him of myself, which was as much
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
Out of our question wipe him.
CAESAR:
You have broken
The article of your oath, which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with.
LEPIDUS:
Soft, Caesar!
ANTONY:
No;
Lepidus, let him speak.
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
The article of my oath-
CAESAR:
To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
The which you both denied.
ANTONY:
Neglected, rather;
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis noble spoken.
MAECENAS:
If it might please you to enforce no further
The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you.
LEPIDUS:
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
ENOBARBUS:
Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
do.
ANTONY:
Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
ENOBARBUS:
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
ANTONY:
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
ENOBARBUS:
Go to, then- your considerate stone!
CAESAR:
I do not much dislike the matter, but
The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
O' th' world, I would pursue it.
AGRIPPA:
Give me leave, Caesar.
CAESAR:
Speak, Agrippa.
AGRIPPA:
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
Is now a widower.
CAESAR:
Say not so, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
Were well deserv'd of rashness.
ANTONY:
I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
Agrippa further speak.
AGRIPPA:
To hold you in perpetual amity,
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot, take Antony
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men;
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter. By this marriage
All little jealousies, which now seem great,
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
Would each to other, and all loves to both,
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
By duty ruminated.
ANTONY:
Will Caesar speak?
CAESAR:
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already.
ANTONY:
What power is in Agrippa,
If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
To make this good?
CAESAR:
The power of Caesar, and
His power unto Octavia.
ANTONY:
May I never
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
Further this act of grace; and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!
CAESAR:
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Fly off our loves again!
LEPIDUS:
Happily, amen!
ANTONY:
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
At heel of that, defy him.
LEPIDUS:
Time calls upon's.
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.
ANTONY:
Where lies he?
CAESAR:
About the Mount Misenum.
ANTONY:
What is his strength by land?
CAESAR:
Great and increasing; but by sea
He is an absolute master.
ANTONY:
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
The business we have talk'd of.
CAESAR:
With most gladness;
And do invite you to my sister's view,
Whither straight I'll lead you.
ANTONY:
Let us, Lepidus,
Not lack your company.
LEPIDUS:
Noble Antony,
Not sickness should detain me.
MAECENAS:
Welcome from Egypt, sir.
ENOBARBUS:
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
friend, Agrippa!
AGRIPPA:
Good Enobarbus!
MAECENAS:
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
ENOBARBUS:
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
the night light with drinking.
MAECENAS:
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
twelve persons there. Is this true?
ENOBARBUS:
This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
MAECENAS:
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
ENOBARBUS:
When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
upon the river of Cydnus.
AGRIPPA:
There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
her.
ENOBARBUS:
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description. She did lie
In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.
AGRIPPA:
O, rare for Antony!
ENOBARBUS:
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
And made their bends adornings. At the helm
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
And made a gap in nature.
AGRIPPA:
Rare Egyptian!
ENOBARBUS:
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper. She replied
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.
AGRIPPA:
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
ENOBARBUS:
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
MAECENAS:
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
ENOBARBUS:
Never! He will not.
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.
MAECENAS:
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
The heart of Antony, Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him.
AGRIPPA:
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here.
ENOBARBUS:
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
ANTONY:
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.
OCTAVIA:
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.
ANTONY:
Good night, sir. My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the world's report.
I have not kept my square; but that to come
Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady.
OCTAVIA:
Good night, sir.
CAESAR:
Good night.
ANTONY:
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
SOOTHSAYER:
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
ANTONY:
If you can- your reason.
SOOTHSAYER:
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but
yet hie you to Egypt again.
ANTONY:
Say to me,
Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
SOOTHSAYER:
Caesar's.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,
Where Caesar's is not; but near him thy angel
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpow'r'd. Therefore
Make space enough between you.
ANTONY:
Speak this no more.
SOOTHSAYER:
To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
If thou dost play with him at any game,
Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck
He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But, he away, 'tis noble.
ANTONY:
Get thee gone.
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
He shall to Parthia.- Be it art or hap,
He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him;
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought, and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt;
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
I' th' East my pleasure lies.
O, come, Ventidius,
You must to Parthia. Your commission's ready;
Follow me and receive't.
LEPIDUS:
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten
Your generals after.
AGRIPPA:
Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
LEPIDUS:
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
MAECENAS:
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount
Before you, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS:
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about.
You'll win two days upon me.
BOTH:
Sir, good success!
LEPIDUS:
Farewell.
CLEOPATRA:
Give me some music- music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.
ALL:
The music, ho!
CLEOPATRA:
Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
CHARMIAN:
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
CLEOPATRA:
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
MARDIAN:
As well as I can, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
And when good will is show'd, though't come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now.
Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up
I'll think them every one an Antony,
And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
CHARMIAN:
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.
CLEOPATRA:
That time? O times
I laughed him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
O! from Italy?
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
That long time have been barren.
MESSENGER:
Madam, madam-
CLEOPATRA:
Antony's dead! If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill'st thy mistress; but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings
Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
MESSENGER:
First, madam, he is well.
CLEOPATRA:
Why, there's more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.
MESSENGER:
Good madam, hear me.
CLEOPATRA:
Well, go to, I will.
But there's no goodness in thy face. If Antony
Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour
To trumpet such good tidings? If not well,
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
Not like a formal man.
MESSENGER:
Will't please you hear me?
CLEOPATRA:
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
Yet, if thou say Antony lives, is well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.
MESSENGER:
Madam, he's well.
CLEOPATRA:
Well said.
MESSENGER:
And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Th'art an honest man.
MESSENGER:
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA:
Make thee a fortune from me.
MESSENGER:
But yet, madam-
CLEOPATRA:
I do not like 'but yet.' It does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar;
In state of health, thou say'st; and, thou say'st, free.
MESSENGER:
Free, madam! No; I made no such report.
He's bound unto Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
For what good turn?
MESSENGER:
For the best turn i' th' bed.
CLEOPATRA:
I am pale, Charmian.
MESSENGER:
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
MESSENGER:
Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA:
What say you? Hence,
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head;
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in ling'ring pickle.
MESSENGER:
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.
CLEOPATRA:
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.
MESSENGER:
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.
MESSENGER:
Nay, then I'll run.
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
CHARMIAN:
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
The man is innocent.
CLEOPATRA:
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!
CHARMIAN:
He is afear'd to come.
CLEOPATRA:
I will not hurt him.
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.
Come hither, sir.
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt.
MESSENGER:
I have done my duty.
CLEOPATRA:
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
If thou again say 'Yes.'
MESSENGER:
He's married, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
MESSENGER:
Should I lie, madam?
CLEOPATRA:
O, I would thou didst,
So half my Egypt were submerg'd and made
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
MESSENGER:
I crave your Highness' pardon.
CLEOPATRA:
He is married?
MESSENGER:
Take no offence that I would not offend you;
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal. He's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA:
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee
That art not what th'art sure of! Get thee hence.
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
And be undone by 'em!
CHARMIAN:
Good your Highness, patience.
CLEOPATRA:
In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
CHARMIAN:
Many times, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
I am paid for't now. Lead me from hence,
I faint. O Iras, Charmian! 'Tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
Her inclination; let him not leave out
The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
Let him for ever go- let him not, Charmian-
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
The other way's a Mars.
Bid you Alexas
Bring me word how tall she is.- Pity me, Charmian,
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
POMPEY:
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
And we shall talk before we fight.
CAESAR:
Most meet
That first we come to words; and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent;
Which if thou hast considered, let us know
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.
POMPEY:
To you all three,
The senators alone of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
There saw you labouring for him. What was't
That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire? and what
Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus,
With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
To drench the Capitol, but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.
CAESAR:
Take your time.
ANTONY:
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
We'll speak with thee at sea; at land thou know'st
How much we do o'er-count thee.
POMPEY:
At land, indeed,
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house.
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in't as thou mayst.
LEPIDUS:
Be pleas'd to tell us-
For this is from the present- how you take
The offers we have sent you.
CAESAR:
There's the point.
ANTONY:
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth embrac'd.
CAESAR:
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.
POMPEY:
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon,
To part with unhack'd edges and bear back
Our targes undinted.
ALL:
That's our offer.
POMPEY:
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepar'd
To take this offer; but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.
ANTONY:
I have heard it, Pompey,
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
POMPEY:
Let me have your hand.
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
ANTONY:
The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gained by't.
CAESAR:
Since I saw you last
There is a change upon you.
POMPEY:
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS:
Well met here.
POMPEY:
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.
CAESAR:
That's the next to do.
POMPEY:
We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
ANTONY:
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY:
No, Antony, take the lot;
But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.
ANTONY:
You have heard much.
POMPEY:
I have fair meanings, sir.
ANTONY:
And fair words to them.
POMPEY:
Then so much have I heard;
And I have heard Apollodorus carried-
ENOBARBUS:
No more of that! He did so.
POMPEY:
What, I pray you?
ENOBARBUS:
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY:
I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
ENOBARBUS:
Well;
And well am like to do, for I perceive
Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY:
Let me shake thy hand.
I never hated thee; I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behaviour.
ENOBARBUS:
Sir,
I never lov'd you much; but I ha' prais'd ye
When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
As I have said you did.
POMPEY:
Enjoy thy plainness;
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all.
Will you lead, lords?
ALL:
Show's the way, sir.
POMPEY:
Come.
MENAS:
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this
treaty.- You and I have known, sir.
ENOBARBUS:
At sea, I think.
MENAS:
We have, sir.
ENOBARBUS:
You have done well by water.
MENAS:
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS:
I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.
MENAS:
Nor what I have done by water.
ENOBARBUS:
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you
have been a great thief by sea.
MENAS:
And you by land.
ENOBARBUS:
There I deny my land service. But give me your hand,
Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two
thieves kissing.
MENAS:
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
ENOBARBUS:
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS:
No slander: they steal hearts.
ENOBARBUS:
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS:
For my part, I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
ENOBARBUS:
If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS:
Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray
you, is he married to Cleopatra?
ENOBARBUS:
Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
MENAS:
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
ENOBARBUS:
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS:
Pray ye, sir?
ENOBARBUS:
'Tis true.
MENAS:
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
ENOBARBUS:
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not
prophesy so.
MENAS:
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
than the love of the parties.
ENOBARBUS:
I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
MENAS:
Who would not have his wife so?
ENOBARBUS:
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He
will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia
blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he
married but his occasion here.
MENAS:
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a
health for you.
ENOBARBUS:
I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.
MENAS:
Come, let's away.
FIRST SERVANT:
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them
down.
SECOND SERVANT:
Lepidus is high-colour'd.
FIRST SERVANT:
They have made him drink alms-drink.
SECOND SERVANT:
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself
to th' drink.
FIRST SERVANT:
But it raises the greater war between him and his
discretion.
SECOND SERVANT:
Why, this it is to have a name in great men's
fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service
as a partizan I could not heave.
FIRST SERVANT:
To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully
disaster the cheeks.
ANTONY:
[To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know
By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.
LEPIDUS:
Y'have strange serpents there.
ANTONY:
Ay, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS:
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
ANTONY:
They are so.
POMPEY:
Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
LEPIDUS:
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
ENOBARBUS:
Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till
then.
LEPIDUS:
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are
very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee,
And hear me speak a word.
POMPEY:
[ Whispers in's ear ] Forbear me till anon-
This wine for Lepidus!
LEPIDUS:
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
ANTONY:
It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own
organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements
once out of it, it transmigrates.
LEPIDUS:
What colour is it of?
ANTONY:
Of it own colour too.
LEPIDUS:
'Tis a strange serpent.
ANTONY:
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
CAESAR:
Will this description satisfy him?
ANTONY:
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
epicure.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS] Go, hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that!
Do as I bid you.- Where's this cup I call'd for?
MENAS:
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear
Rise from thy stool.
POMPEY:
[Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks
aside] The matter?
MENAS:
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY:
Thou hast serv'd me with much faith. What's else to say?-
Be jolly, lords.
ANTONY:
These quicksands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.
MENAS:
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY:
What say'st thou?
MENAS:
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY:
How should that be?
MENAS:
But entertain it,
And though you think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.
POMPEY:
Hast thou drunk well?
MENAS:
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
POMPEY:
Show me which way.
MENAS:
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable;
And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
All there is thine.
POMPEY:
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act. Being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done,
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
MENAS:
[Aside] For this,
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
Shall never find it more.
POMPEY:
This health to Lepidus!
ANTONY:
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
ENOBARBUS:
Here's to thee, Menas!
MENAS:
Enobarbus, welcome!
POMPEY:
Fill till the cup be hid.
ENOBARBUS:
There's a strong fellow, Menas.
MENAS:
Why?
ENOBARBUS:
'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
MENAS:
The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!
ENOBARBUS:
Drink thou; increase the reels.
MENAS:
Come.
POMPEY:
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
ANTONY:
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
Here's to Caesar!
CAESAR:
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour when I wash my brain
And it grows fouler.
ANTONY:
Be a child o' th' time.
CAESAR:
Possess it, I'll make answer.
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.
ENOBARBUS:
[To ANTONY] Ha, my brave emperor!
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
And celebrate our drink?
POMPEY:
Let's ha't, good soldier.
ANTONY:
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.
ENOBARBUS:
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music,
The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.
CAESAR:
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off; our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.
POMPEY:
I'll try you on the shore.
ANTONY:
And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
POMPEY:
O Antony,
You have my father's house- but what? We are friends.
Come, down into the boat.
ENOBARBUS:
Take heed you fall not.
Menas, I'll not on shore.
MENAS:
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows. Sound and be hang'd, sound out!
ENOBARBUS:
Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.
MENAS:
Hoo! Noble Captain, come.
VENTIDIUS:
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
Pleas'd fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS:
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.
VENTIDIUS:
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
May make too great an act; for learn this, Silius:
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer, than person. Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain; and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.
SILIUS:
Thou hast, Ventidius, that
Without the which a soldier and his sword
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?
VENTIDIUS:
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' th' field.
SILIUS:
Where is he now?
VENTIDIUS:
He purposeth to Athens; whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
We shall appear before him.- On, there; pass along.
AGRIPPA:
What, are the brothers parted?
ENOBARBUS:
They have dispatch'd with Pompey; he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.
AGRIPPA:
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
ENOBARBUS:
A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA:
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
ENOBARBUS:
Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA:
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
ENOBARBUS:
Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
AGRIPPA:
O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
ENOBARBUS:
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
AGRIPPA:
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
ENOBARBUS:
But he loves Caesar best. Yet he loves Antony.
Hoo! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number- hoo!-
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
AGRIPPA:
Both he loves.
ENOBARBUS:
They are his shards, and he their beetle. [Trumpets
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
AGRIPPA:
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
ANTONY:
No further, sir.
CAESAR:
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love
To keep it builded be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have lov'd without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.
ANTONY:
Make me not offended
In your distrust.
CAESAR:
I have said.
ANTONY:
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.
CAESAR:
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
The elements be kind to thee and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.
OCTAVIA:
My noble brother!
ANTONY:
The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
OCTAVIA:
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-
CAESAR:
What, Octavia?
OCTAVIA:
I'll tell you in your ear.
ANTONY:
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather,
That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
And neither way inclines.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
AGRIPPA:
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a
So is he, being a man.
AGRIPPA:
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was troubled
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't- till I weep too.
CAESAR:
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.
ANTONY:
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.
CAESAR:
Adieu; be happy!
LEPIDUS:
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
CAESAR:
Farewell, farewell!
ANTONY:
Farewell!
CLEOPATRA:
Where is the fellow?
ALEXAS:
Half afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA:
Go to, go to.
Come hither, sir.
ALEXAS:
Good Majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleas'd.
CLEOPATRA:
That Herod's head
I'll have. But how, when Antony is gone,
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
MESSENGER:
Most gracious Majesty!
CLEOPATRA:
Didst thou behold Octavia?
MESSENGER:
Ay, dread Queen.
CLEOPATRA:
Where?
MESSENGER:
Madam, in Rome
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
CLEOPATRA:
Is she as tall as me?
MESSENGER:
She is not, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
MESSENGER:
Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
CLEOPATRA:
That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
CHARMIAN:
Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
CLEOPATRA:
I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
MESSENGER:
She creeps.
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.
CLEOPATRA:
Is this certain?
MESSENGER:
Or I have no observance.
CHARMIAN:
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.
CLEOPATRA:
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't. There's nothing in her yet.
The fellow has good judgment.
CHARMIAN:
Excellent.
CLEOPATRA:
Guess at her years, I prithee.
MESSENGER:
Madam,
She was a widow.
CLEOPATRA:
Widow? Charmian, hark!
MESSENGER:
And I do think she's thirty.
CLEOPATRA:
Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
MESSENGER:
Round even to faultiness.
CLEOPATRA:
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?
MESSENGER:
Brown, madam; and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.
CLEOPATRA:
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business. Go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepar'd.
CHARMIAN:
A proper man.
CLEOPATRA:
Indeed, he is so. I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.
CHARMIAN:
Nothing, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
CHARMIAN:
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!
CLEOPATRA:
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian.
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.
CHARMIAN:
I warrant you, madam.
ANTONY:
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
That were excusable, that and thousands more
Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear;
Spoke scandy of me; when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
Or did it from his teeth.
OCTAVIA:
O my good lord,
Believe not all; or if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
Praying for both parts.
The good gods will mock me presently
When I shall pray 'O, bless my lord and husband!'
Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way
'Twixt these extremes at all.
ANTONY:
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour,
I lose myself; better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady,
I'll raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.
OCTAVIA:
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift.
ANTONY:
When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.
ENOBARBUS:
How now, friend Eros!
EROS:
There's strange news come, sir.
ENOBARBUS:
What, man?
EROS:
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
ENOBARBUS:
This is old. What is the success?
EROS:
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey,
presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the
glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters
he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him.
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
ENOBARBUS:
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps- no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
EROS:
He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murd'red Pompey.
ENOBARBUS:
Our great navy's rigg'd.
EROS:
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
My lord desires you presently; my news
I might have told hereafter.
ENOBARBUS:
'Twill be naught;
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
EROS:
Come, sir.
CAESAR:
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't:
I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.
MAECENAS:
This in the public eye?
CAESAR:
I' th' common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia,
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.
MAECENAS:
Let Rome be thus
Inform'd.
AGRIPPA:
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
CAESAR:
The people knows it, and have now receiv'd
His accusations.
AGRIPPA:
Who does he accuse?
CAESAR:
Caesar; and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me
Some shipping, unrestor'd. Lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be depos'd; and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.
AGRIPPA:
Sir, this should be answer'd.
CAESAR:
'Tis done already, and messenger gone.
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
That he his high authority abus'd,
And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
Demand the like.
MAECENAS:
He'll never yield to that.
CAESAR:
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
OCTAVIA:
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
CAESAR:
That ever I should call thee cast-away!
OCTAVIA:
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
CAESAR:
Why have you stol'n upon us thus? You come not
Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way
Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Rais'd by your populous troops. But you are come
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
Is often left unlov'd. We should have met you
By sea and land, supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.
OCTAVIA:
Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did it
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepar'd for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg'd
His pardon for return.
CAESAR:
Which soon he granted,
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
OCTAVIA:
Do not say so, my lord.
CAESAR:
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?
OCTAVIA:
My lord, in Athens.
CAESAR:
No, my most wronged sister: Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore, who now are levying
The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with
More larger list of sceptres.
OCTAVIA:
Ay me most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends,
That does afflict each other!
CAESAR:
Welcome hither.
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities,
But let determin'd things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abus'd
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,
To do you justice, make their ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
And ever welcome to us.
AGRIPPA:
Welcome, lady.
MAECENAS:
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
Only th' adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off,
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us.
OCTAVIA:
Is it so, sir?
CAESAR:
Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
Be ever known to patience. My dear'st sister!
CLEOPATRA:
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
ENOBARBUS:
But why, why,
CLEOPATRA:
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit.
ENOBARBUS:
Well, is it, is it?
CLEOPATRA:
Is't not denounc'd against us? Why should not we
Be there in person?
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
If we should serve with horse and mares together
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.
CLEOPATRA:
What is't you say?
ENOBARBUS:
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain, from's time,
What should not then be spar'd. He is already
Traduc'd for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.
CLEOPATRA:
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it;
I will not stay behind.
ENOBARBUS:
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the Emperor.
ANTONY:
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?
CLEOPATRA:
Celerity is never more admir'd
Than by the negligent.
ANTONY:
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becom'd the best of men
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.
CLEOPATRA:
By sea! What else?
CANIDIUS:
Why will my lord do so?
ANTONY:
For that he dares us to't.
ENOBARBUS:
So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
CANIDIUS:
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off;
And so should you.
ENOBARBUS:
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress. In Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought;
Their ships are yare; yours heavy. No disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepar'd for land.
ANTONY:
By sea, by sea.
ENOBARBUS:
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
From firm security.
ANTONY:
I'll fight at sea.
CLEOPATRA:
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
ANTONY:
Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
We then can do't at land.
Thy business?
MESSENGER:
The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
Caesar has taken Toryne.
ANTONY:
Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
Away, my Thetis!
How now, worthy soldier?
SOLDIER:
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth
And fighting foot to foot.
ANTONY:
Well, well- away.
SOLDIER:
By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
CANIDIUS:
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
Not in the power on't. So our leader's led,
And we are women's men.
SOLDIER:
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
CANIDIUS:
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.
SOLDIER:
While he was yet in Rome,
His power went out in such distractions as
Beguil'd all spies.
CANIDIUS:
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
SOLDIER:
They say one Taurus.
CANIDIUS:
Well I know the man.
MESSENGER:
The Emperor calls Canidius.
CANIDIUS:
With news the time's with labour and throes forth
Each minute some.
CAESAR:
Taurus!
TAURUS:
My lord?
CAESAR:
Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies
Upon this jump.
ANTONY:
Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
We may the number of the ships behold,
And so proceed accordingly.
ENOBARBUS:
Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
To see't mine eyes are blasted.
SCARUS:
Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!
ENOBARBUS:
What's thy passion?
SCARUS:
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.
ENOBARBUS:
How appears the fight?
SCARUS:
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt-
Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder-
The breese upon her, like a cow in June-
Hoists sails and flies.
ENOBARBUS:
That I beheld;
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
Endure a further view.
SCARUS:
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.
ENOBARBUS:
Alack, alack!
CANIDIUS:
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
O, he has given example for our flight
Most grossly by his own!
ENOBARBUS:
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why then, good night indeed.
CANIDIUS:
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
SCARUS:
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.
CANIDIUS:
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse; six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.
ENOBARBUS:
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.
ANTONY:
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.
I am so lated in the world that I
Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship
Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,
And make your peace with Caesar.
ALL:
Fly? Not we!
ANTONY:
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
I have myself resolv'd upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone.
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
I follow'd that I blush to look upon.
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone; you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way.
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now;
Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command;
Therefore I pray you. I'll see you by and by.
EROS:
Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
IRAS:
Do, most dear Queen.
CHARMIAN:
Do? Why, what else?
CLEOPATRA:
Let me sit down. O Juno!
ANTONY:
No, no, no, no, no.
EROS:
See you here, sir?
ANTONY:
O, fie, fie, fie!
CHARMIAN:
Madam!
IRAS:
Madam, O good Empress!
EROS:
Sir, sir!
ANTONY:
Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
His sword e'en like a dancer, while I struck
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
That the mad Brutus ended; he alone
Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had
In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter.
CLEOPATRA:
Ah, stand by!
EROS:
The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
IRAS:
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
He is unqualitied with very shame.
CLEOPATRA:
Well then, sustain me. O!
EROS:
Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches.
Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
Your comfort makes the rescue.
ANTONY:
I have offended reputation-
A most unnoble swerving.
EROS:
Sir, the Queen.
ANTONY:
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
By looking back what I have left behind
'Stroy'd in dishonour.
CLEOPATRA:
O my lord, my lord,
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
You would have followed.
ANTONY:
Egypt, thou knew'st too well
My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings,
And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
Command me.
CLEOPATRA:
O, my pardon!
ANTONY:
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd,
Making and marring fortunes. You did know
How much you were my conqueror, and that
My sword, made weak by my affection, would
Obey it on all cause.
CLEOPATRA:
Pardon, pardon!
ANTONY:
Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
Even this repays me.
We sent our schoolmaster; is 'a come back?
Love, I am full of lead. Some wine,
Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
CAESAR:
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.
CAESAR:
Approach, and speak.
EUPHRONIUS:
Such as I am, I come from Antony.
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
To his grand sea.
CAESAR:
Be't so. Declare thine office.
EUPHRONIUS:
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
He lessens his requests and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
A private man in Athens. This for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.
CAESAR:
For Antony,
I have no ears to his request. The Queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
Or take his life there. This if she perform,
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
EUPHRONIUS:
Fortune pursue thee!
CAESAR:
Bring him through the bands.
From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise,
And in our name, what she requires; add more,
From thine invention, offers. Women are not
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus;
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
Will answer as a law.
THYREUS:
Caesar, I go.
CAESAR:
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
In every power that moves.
THYREUS:
Caesar, I shall.
CLEOPATRA:
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
ENOBARBUS:
Think, and die.
CLEOPATRA:
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
ENOBARBUS:
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship, at such a point,
When half to half the world oppos'd, he being
The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing.
CLEOPATRA:
Prithee, peace.
ANTONY:
Is that his answer?
EUPHRONIUS:
Ay, my lord.
ANTONY:
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up.
EUPHRONIUS:
He says so.
ANTONY:
Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.
CLEOPATRA:
That head, my lord?
ANTONY:
To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it. Follow me.
EUPHRONIUS:
[Aside] Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them,
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
His judgment too.
SERVANT:
A messenger from Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
And earns a place i' th' story.
CLEOPATRA:
Caesar's will?
THYREUS:
Hear it apart.
CLEOPATRA:
None but friends: say boldly.
THYREUS:
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
ENOBARBUS:
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know
Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar's.
THYREUS:
So.
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
Further than he is Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Go on. Right royal!
THYREUS:
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
CLEOPATRA:
O!
THYREUS:
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserv'd.
CLEOPATRA:
He is a god, and knows
What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside] To be sure of that,
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee.
THYREUS:
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? For he partly begs
To be desir'd to give. It much would please him
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shroud,
The universal landlord.
CLEOPATRA:
What's your name?
THYREUS:
My name is Thyreus.
CLEOPATRA:
Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
I kiss his conquring hand. Tell him I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.
THYREUS:
'Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together,
If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.
CLEOPATRA:
Your Caesar's father oft,
When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
As it rain'd kisses.
ANTONY:
Favours, by Jove that thunders!
What art thou, fellow?
THYREUS:
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
To have command obey'd.
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside] You will be whipt.
ANTONY:
Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.
Take hence this Jack and whip him.
ENOBARBUS:
'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
Than with an old one dying.
ANTONY:
Moon and stars!
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
THYMUS:
Mark Antony-
ANTONY:
Tug him away. Being whipt,
Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall
Bear us an errand to him.
You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha!
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
By one that looks on feeders?
CLEOPATRA:
Good my lord-
ANTONY:
You have been a boggler ever.
But when we in our viciousness grow hard-
O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes,
In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
To our confusion.
CLEOPATRA:
O, is't come to this?
ANTONY:
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher. Nay, you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,
Unregist'red in vulgar fame, you have
Luxuriously pick'd out; for I am sure,
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
You know not what it is.
CLEOPATRA:
Wherefore is this?
ANTONY:
To let a fellow that will take rewards,
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
And to proclaim it civilly were like
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him.
Is he whipt?
SERVANT:
Soundly, my lord.
ANTONY:
Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
SERVANT:
He did ask favour.
ANTONY:
If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee!
Shake thou to look on't. Get thee back to Caesar;
Tell him thy entertainment; look thou say
He makes me angry with him; for he seems
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry;
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
When my good stars, that were my former guides,
Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture,
As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou.
Hence with thy stripes, be gone.
CLEOPATRA:
Have you done yet?
ANTONY:
Alack, our terrene moon
Is now eclips'd, and it portends alone
The fall of Antony.
CLEOPATRA:
I must stay his time.
ANTONY:
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points?
CLEOPATRA:
Not know me yet?
ANTONY:
Cold-hearted toward me?
CLEOPATRA:
Ah, dear, if I be so,
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
And poison it in the source, and the first stone
Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey.
ANTONY:
I am satisfied.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy to
Have knit again, and fleet, threat'ning most sea-like.
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
There's hope in't yet.
CLEOPATRA:
That's my brave lord!
ANTONY:
I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
Let's have one other gaudy night. Call to me
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
Let's mock the midnight bell.
CLEOPATRA:
It is my birthday.
I had thought t'have held it poor; but since my lord
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
ANTONY:
We will yet do well.
CLEOPATRA:
Call all his noble captains to my lord.
ANTONY:
Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
I'll make death love me; for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.
ENOBARBUS:
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
A diminution in our captain's brain
Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason,
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
Some way to leave him.
CAESAR:
He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
He hath whipt with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die, meantime
Laugh at his challenge.
MAECENAS:
Caesar must think
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
Made good guard for itself.
CAESAR:
Let our best heads
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight. Within our files there are
Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late
Enough to fetch him in. See it done;
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
ANTONY:
He will not fight with me, Domitius?
ENOBARBUS:
No.
ANTONY:
Why should he not?
ENOBARBUS:
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.
ANTONY:
To-morrow, soldier,
By sea and land I'll fight. Or I will live,
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
ENOBARBUS:
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
ANTONY:
Well said; come on.
Call forth my household servants; let's to-night
Be bounteous at our meal.
Give me thy hand,
Thou has been rightly honest. So hast thou;
Thou, and thou, and thou. You have serv'd me well,
And kings have been your fellows.
CLEOPATRA:
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?
ENOBARBUS:
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd tricks which
Out of the mind.
ANTONY:
And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men,
And all of you clapp'd up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
So good as you have done.
SERVANT:
The gods forbid!
ANTONY:
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too,
And suffer'd my command.
CLEOPATRA:
[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
ENOBARBUS. To make his followers weep.
ANTONY:
Tend me to-night;
May be it is the period of your duty.
Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
You'll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn you not away; but, like a master
Married to your good service, stay till death.
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for't!
ENOBARBUS:
What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
Transform us not to women.
ANTONY:
Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense;
For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
And drown consideration.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
SECOND SOLDIER:
It will determine one way. Fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
FIRST SOLDIER:
Nothing. What news?
SECOND SOLDIER:
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Well, sir, good night.
SECOND SOLDIER:
Soldiers, have careful watch.
FIRST SOLDIER:
And you. Good night, good night.
SECOND SOLDIER:
Here we. And if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.
THIRD SOLDIER:
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.
SECOND SOLDIER:
Peace, what noise?
THIRD SOLDIER:
List, list!
SECOND SOLDIER:
Hark!
THIRD SOLDIER:
Music i' th' air.
FOURTH SOLDIER:
Under the earth.
THIRD SOLDIER:
It signs well, does it not?
FOURTH SOLDIER:
No.
THIRD SOLDIER:
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?
SECOND SOLDIER:
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
Now leaves him.
THIRD SOLDIER:
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do.
SECOND SOLDIER:
How now, masters!
SOLDIERS:
[Speaking together] How now!
How now! Do you hear this?
FIRST SOLDIER:
Ay; is't not strange?
THIRD SOLDIER:
Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?
FIRST SOLDIER:
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
SOLDIERS:
Content. 'Tis strange.
ANTONY:
Eros! mine armour, Eros!
CLEOPATRA:
Sleep a little.
ANTONY:
No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
Come, good fellow, put mine iron on.
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her. Come.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?
ANTONY:
Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this.
CLEOPATRA:
Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.
ANTONY:
Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.
EROS:
Briefly, sir.
CLEOPATRA:
Is not this buckled well?
ANTONY:
Rarely, rarely!
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen's a squire
More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
A workman in't.
Good-morrow to thee. Welcome.
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge.
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.
SOLDIER:
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.
CAPTAIN:
The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.
ALL:
Good morrow, General.
ANTONY:
'Tis well blown, lads.
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said.
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me.
This is a soldier's kiss. Rebukeable,
And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
CHARMIAN:
Please you retire to your chamber?
CLEOPATRA:
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then, Antony- but now. Well, on.
SOLDIER:
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
ANTONY:
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!
SOLDIER:
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Followed thy heels.
ANTONY:
Who's gone this morning?
SOLDIER:
Who?
One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'
ANTONY:
What say'st thou?
SOLDIER:
Sir,
He is with Caesar.
EROS:
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.
ANTONY:
Is he gone?
SOLDIER:
Most certain.
ANTONY:
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him-
I will subscribe- gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!
CAESAR:
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known.
AGRIPPA:
Caesar, I shall.
CAESAR:
The time of universal peace is near.
Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world
Shall bear the olive freely.
MESSENGER:
Antony
Is come into the field.
CAESAR:
Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself.
ENOBARBUS:
Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
And leave his master Antony. For this pains
Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honourable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
That I will joy no more.
SOLDIER:
Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus. The messenger
Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.
ENOBARBUS:
I give it you.
SOLDIER:
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer
Out of the host. I must attend mine office,
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.
ENOBARBUS:
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought; but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee? No! I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.
AGRIPPA:
Retire. We have engag'd ourselves too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.
SCARUS:
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.
ANTONY:
Thou bleed'st apace.
SCARUS:
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.
ANTONY:
They do retire.
SCARUS:
We'll beat'em into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
EROS:
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.
SCARUS:
Let us score their backs
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
ANTONY:
I will reward thee
Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
For thy good valour. Come thee on.
SCARUS. I'll halt after.
ANTONY:
We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood
That has to-day escap'd. I thank you all;
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
The honour'd gashes whole.
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world,
Chain mine arm'd neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing.
CLEOPATRA:
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?
ANTONY:
Mine nightingale,
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! though grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand-
Kiss it, my warrior- he hath fought to-day
As if a god in hate of mankind had
Destroyed in such a shape.
CLEOPATRA:
I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
ANTONY:
He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand.
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them.
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
Make mingle with our rattling tabourines,
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
Applauding our approach.
CENTURION:
If we be not reliev'd within this hour,
We must return to th' court of guard. The night
Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
By th' second hour i' th' morn.
FIRST WATCH:
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.
ENOBARBUS:
O, bear me witness, night-
SECOND WATCH:
What man is this?
FIRST WATCH:
Stand close and list him.
ENOBARBUS:
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!
CENTURION:
Enobarbus?
SECOND WATCH:
Peace!
Hark further.
ENOBARBUS:
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular,
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
O Antony! O Antony!
FIRST WATCH:
Let's speak to him.
CENTURION:
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.
SECOND WATCH:
Let's do so. But he sleeps.
CENTURION:
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.
FIRST WATCH:
Go we to him.
SECOND WATCH:
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
FIRST WATCH:
Hear you, sir?
CENTURION:
The hand of death hath raught him.
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
Is fully out.
SECOND WATCH:
Come on, then;
He may recover yet.
ANTONY:
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
We please them not by land.
SCARUS:
For both, my lord.
ANTONY:
I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
We'd fight there too. But this it is, our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us- Order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven-
Where their appointment we may best discover
And look on their endeavour.
CAESAR:
But being charg'd, we will be still by land,
Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
And hold our best advantage.
ANTONY:
Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
I shall discover all. I'll bring thee word
Straight how 'tis like to go.
SCARUS:
Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers
Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
Is valiant and dejected; and by starts
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
Of what he has and has not.
ANTONY:
All is lost!
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am reveng'd upon my charm,
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more!
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am.
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm-
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home,
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end-
Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose
Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
What, Eros, Eros!
Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
CLEOPATRA:
Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
ANTONY:
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
For poor'st diminutives, for doits, and let
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
With her prepared nails.
'Tis well th'art gone,
If it be well to live; but better 'twere
Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon,
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
Under this plot. She dies for't. Eros, ho!
CLEOPATRA:
Help me, my women. O, he is more mad
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so emboss'd.
CHARMIAN:
To th'monument!
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.
CLEOPATRA:
To th' monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
ANTONY:
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
EROS:
Ay, noble lord.
ANTONY:
Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon't that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.
EROS:
Ay, my lord.
ANTONY:
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
As water is in water.
EROS:
It does, my lord.
ANTONY:
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body. Here I am Antony;
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen-
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,
Which, whilst it was mine, had annex'd unto't
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
Unto an enemy's triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.
O, thy vile lady!
She has robb'd me of my sword.
MARDIAN:
No, Antony;
My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely.
ANTONY:
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.
MARDIAN:
Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips. She rend'red life,
Thy name so buried in her.
ANTONY:
Dead then?
MARDIAN:
Dead.
ANTONY:
Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
Does pay thy labour richly. Go.
Off, pluck off!
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
Crack thy frail case. Apace, Eros, apace.-
No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne.- From me awhile.
I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
All length is torture. Since the torch is out,
Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour
Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
Eros!- I come, my queen.- Eros!- Stay for me;
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
EROS:
What would my lord?
ANTONY:
Since Cleopatra died,
I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, when the exigent should come- which now
Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
Th' inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come.
Thou strik'st not me; 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
Put colour in thy cheek.
EROS:
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim and could not?
ANTONY:
Eros,
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, his face subdu'd
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
His baseness that ensued?
EROS:
I would not see't.
ANTONY:
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country.
EROS:
O, sir, pardon me!
ANTONY:
When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurpos'd. Draw, and come.
EROS:
Turn from me then that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
ANTONY:
Lo thee!
EROS:
My sword is drawn.
ANTONY:
Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it.
EROS:
My dear master,
My captain and my emperor, let me say,
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
ANTONY:
'Tis said, man; and farewell.
EROS:
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
ANTONY:
Now, Eros.
EROS:
Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow
Of Antony's death.
ANTONY:
Thrice nobler than myself!
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
I learn'd of thee. How? not dead? not dead?-
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
FIRST GUARD:
What's the noise?
ANTONY:
I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
Of what I have begun.
SECOND GUARD:
The star is fall'n.
FIRST GUARD:
And time is at his period.
ALL:
Alas, and woe!
ANTONY:
Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
FIRST GUARD:
Not I.
SECOND GUARD:
Nor I.
THIRD GUARD:
Nor any one.
DERCETAS:
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
Shall enter me with him.
DIOMEDES:
Where's Antony?
DERCETAS:
There, Diomed, there.
DIOMEDES:
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?
ANTONY:
Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
Sufficing strokes for death.
DIOMEDES:
Most absolute lord,
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
ANTONY:
When did she send thee?
DIOMEDES:
Now, my lord.
ANTONY:
Where is she?
DIOMEDES:
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw-
Which never shall be found- you did suspect
She had dispos'd with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purg'd, she sent you word she was dead;
But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.
ANTONY:
Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
DIOMEDES:
What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho!
Come, your lord calls!
ANTONY:
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
FIRST GUARD:
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
All your true followers out.
ALL:
Most heavy day!
ANTONY:
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
Which comes to punish us, and we punish it,
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends,
And have my thanks for all.
CLEOPATRA:
O Charmian, I will never go from hence!
CHARMIAN:
Be comforted, dear madam.
CLEOPATRA:
No, I will not.
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it.
How now! Is he dead?
DIOMEDES:
His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' th' other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.
CLEOPATRA:
O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand
The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony,
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
Help, friends below! Let's draw him hither.
ANTONY:
Peace!
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
CLEOPATRA:
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
ANTONY:
I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
I here importune death awhile, until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips.
CLEOPATRA:
I dare not, dear.
Dear my lord, pardon! I dare not,
Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show
Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me. If knife, drugs, serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony-
Help me, my women- we must draw thee up;
Assist, good friends.
ANTONY:
O, quick, or I am gone.
CLEOPATRA:
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness;
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
Wishers were ever fools. O come, come,
And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.
ALL:
A heavy sight!
ANTONY:
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
CLEOPATRA:
No, let me speak; and let me rail so high
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
Provok'd by my offence.
ANTONY:
One word, sweet queen:
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
CLEOPATRA:
They do not go together.
ANTONY:
Gentle, hear me:
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA:
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar
ANTONY:
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world,
The noblest; and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman- a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going
I can no more.
CLEOPATRA:
Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord!
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls
Are level now with men. The odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.
CHARMIAN:
O, quietness, lady!
IRAS:
She's dead too, our sovereign.
CHARMIAN:
Lady!
IRAS:
Madam!
CHARMIAN:
O madam, madam, madam!
IRAS:
Royal Egypt, Empress!
CHARMIAN:
Peace, peace, Iras!
CLEOPATRA:
No more but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
Patience is sottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
But resolution and the briefest end.
CAESAR:
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
The pauses that he makes.
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, I shall.
CAESAR:
Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar'st
Appear thus to us?
DERCETAS:
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I serv'd, who best was worthy
Best to be serv'd. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
He was my master, and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.
CAESAR:
What is't thou say'st?
DERCETAS:
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
CAESAR:
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack. The round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets,
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
Is not a single doom; in the name lay
A moiety of the world.
DERCETAS:
He is dead, Caesar,
Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand
Which writ his honour in the acts it did
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.
CAESAR:
Look you sad, friends?
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings.
AGRIPPA:
And strange it is
That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds.
MAECENAS:
His taints and honours
Wag'd equal with him.
AGRIPPA:
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity. But you gods will give us
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
MAECENAS:
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
He needs must see himself.
CAESAR:
O Antony,
I have follow'd thee to this! But we do lance
Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day
Or look on thine; we could not stall together
In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
That thou, my brother, my competitor
In top of all design, my mate in empire,
Friend and companion in the front of war,
The arm of mine own body, and the heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars,
Unreconciliable, should divide
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-
But I will tell you at some meeter season.
The business of this man looks out of him;
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
EGYPTIAN:
A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress,
Confin'd in all she has, her monument,
Of thy intents desires instruction,
That she preparedly may frame herself
To th' way she's forc'd to.
CAESAR:
Bid her have good heart.
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot learn
To be ungentle.
EGYPTIAN:
So the gods preserve thee!
CAESAR:
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require,
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find her.
PROCULEIUS:
Caesar, I shall.
CAESAR:
Gallus, go you along.
Where's Dolabella, to second Proculeius?
ALL:
Dolabella!
CAESAR:
Let him alone, for I remember now
How he's employ'd; he shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war,
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings. Go with me, and see
What I can show in this.
CLEOPATRA:
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
A minister of her will; and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
PROCULEIUS:
Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt,
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
CLEOPATRA:
What's thy name?
PROCULEIUS:
My name is Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA:
Antony
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
That have no use for trusting. If your master
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks.
PROCULEIUS:
Be of good cheer;
Y'are fall'n into a princely hand; fear nothing.
Make your full reference freely to my lord,
Who is so full of grace that it flows over
On all that need. Let me report to him
Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
CLEOPATRA:
Pray you tell him
I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
Look him i' th' face.
PROCULEIUS:
This I'll report, dear lady.
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
Of him that caus'd it.
GALLUS:
You see how easily she may be surpris'd.
Guard her till Caesar come.
IRAS:
Royal Queen!
CHARMIAN:
O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
CLEOPATRA:
Quick, quick, good hands.
PROCULEIUS:
Hold, worthy lady, hold,
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
Reliev'd, but not betray'd.
CLEOPATRA:
What, of death too,
That rids our dogs of languish?
PROCULEIUS:
Cleopatra,
Do not abuse my master's bounty by
Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
His nobleness well acted, which your death
Will never let come forth.
CLEOPATRA:
Where art thou, death?
Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
Worth many babes and beggars!
PROCULEIUS:
O, temperance, lady!
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, I will eat no meat; I'll not drink, sir;
If idle talk will once be necessary,
I'll not sleep neither. This mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,
Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus' mud
Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies
Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
And hang me up in chains!
PROCULEIUS:
You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar.
DOLABELLA:
Proculeius,
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
I'll take her to my guard.
PROCULEIUS:
So, Dolabella,
It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
If you'll employ me to him.
CLEOPATRA:
Say I would die.
DOLABELLA:
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
CLEOPATRA:
I cannot tell.
DOLABELLA:
Assuredly you know me.
CLEOPATRA:
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
Is't not your trick?
DOLABELLA:
I understand not, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony-
O, such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man!
DOLABELLA:
If it might please ye-
CLEOPATRA:
His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
The little O, the earth.
DOLABELLA:
Most sovereign creature-
CLEOPATRA:
His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm
Crested the world. His voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping. His delights
Were dolphin-like: they show'd his back above
The element they liv'd in. In his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
DOLABELLA:
Cleopatra-
CLEOPATRA:
Think you there was or might be such a man
As this I dreamt of?
DOLABELLA:
Gentle madam, no.
CLEOPATRA:
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But if there be nor ever were one such,
It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t' imagine
An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.
DOLABELLA:
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is, as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight. Would I might never
O'ertake pursu'd success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.
CLEOPATRA:
I thank you, sir.
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
DOLABELLA:
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, pray you, sir.
DOLABELLA:
Though he be honourable-
CLEOPATRA:
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
DOLABELLA:
Madam, he will. I know't.
CAESAR:
Which is the Queen of Egypt?
DOLABELLA:
It is the Emperor, madam.
CAESAR:
Arise, you shall not kneel.
I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
CLEOPATRA:
Sir, the gods
Will have it thus; my master and my lord
I must obey.
CAESAR:
Take to you no hard thoughts.
The record of what injuries you did us,
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
As things but done by chance.
CLEOPATRA:
Sole sir o' th' world,
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear, but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often sham'd our sex.
CAESAR:
Cleopatra, know
We will extenuate rather than enforce.
If you apply yourself to our intents-
Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty by taking
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
Of my good purposes, and put your children
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
CLEOPATRA:
And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we,
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
CAESAR:
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
CLEOPATRA:
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
I am possess'd of. 'Tis exactly valued,
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
SELEUCUS:
Here, madam.
CLEOPATRA:
This is my treasurer; let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserv'd
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
SELEUCUS:
Madam,
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
Speak that which is not.
CLEOPATRA:
What have I kept back?
SELEUCUS:
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
CAESAR:
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
Your wisdom in the deed.
CLEOPATRA:
See, Caesar! O, behold,
How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours;
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
Than love that's hir'd! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes
Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!
CAESAR:
Good Queen, let us entreat you.
CLEOPATRA:
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
That thou vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I some lady trifles have reserv'd,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation- must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
Beneath the fall I have. Prithee go hence;
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
CAESAR:
Forbear, Seleucus.
CLEOPATRA:
Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and when we fall
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.
CAESAR:
Cleopatra,
Not what you have reserv'd, nor what acknowledg'd,
Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours,
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear Queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.
Our care and pity is so much upon you
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
CLEOPATRA:
My master and my lord!
CAESAR:
Not so. Adieu.
CLEOPATRA:
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian!
IRAS:
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
And we are for the dark.
CLEOPATRA:
Hie thee again.
I have spoke already, and it is provided;
Go put it to the haste.
CHARMIAN:
Madam, I will.
DOLABELLA:
Where's the Queen?
CHARMIAN:
Behold, sir.
CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella!
DOLABELLA:
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
Which my love makes religion to obey,
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey, and within three days
You with your children will he send before.
Make your best use of this; I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.
CLEOPATRA:
Dolabella,
I shall remain your debtor.
DOLABELLA:
I your servant.
Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
CLEOPATRA:
Farewell, and thanks.
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves,
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
And forc'd to drink their vapour.
IRAS:
The gods forbid!
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us, and present
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' th' posture of a whore.
IRAS:
O the good gods!
CLEOPATRA:
Nay, that's certain.
IRAS:
I'll never see't, for I am sure mine nails
Are stronger than mine eyes.
CLEOPATRA:
Why, that's the way
To fool their preparation and to conquer
Their most absurd intents.
Now, Charmian!
Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch
My best attires. I am again for Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah, Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
Wherefore's this noise?
GUARDSMAN:
Here is a rural fellow
That will not be denied your Highness' presence.
He brings you figs.
CLEOPATRA:
Let him come in.
What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
My resolution's plac'd, and I have nothing
Of woman in me. Now from head to foot
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.
GUARDSMAN:
This is the man.
CLEOPATRA:
Avoid, and leave him.
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
That kills and pains not?
CLOWN:
Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover.
CLEOPATRA:
Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
CLOWN:
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no
longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given
to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how
she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes
a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that
they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is
most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Get thee hence; farewell.
CLOWN:
I wish you all joy of the worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Farewell.
CLOWN:
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his
kind.
CLEOPATRA:
Ay, ay; farewell.
CLOWN:
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
CLOWN:
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth
the feeding.
CLEOPATRA:
Will it eat me?
CLOWN:
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for
the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same
whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in
every ten that they make the devils mar five.
CLEOPATRA:
Well, get thee gone; farewell.
CLOWN:
Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o' th' worm.
CLEOPATRA:
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me. Now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call. I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come.
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So, have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.
CHARMIAN:
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
The gods themselves do weep.
CLEOPATRA:
This proves me base.
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
Be angry and dispatch. O couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!
CHARMIAN:
O Eastern star!
CLEOPATRA:
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
That sucks the nurse asleep?
CHARMIAN:
O, break! O, break!
CLEOPATRA:
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle-
O Antony! Nay, I will take thee too:
What should I stay-
CHARMIAN:
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it and then play-
FIRST GUARD:
Where's the Queen?
CHARMIAN:
Speak softly, wake her not.
FIRST GUARD:
Caesar hath sent-
CHARMIAN:
Too slow a messenger.
O, come apace, dispatch. I partly feel thee.
FIRST GUARD:
Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
SECOND GUARD:
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
FIRST GUARD:
What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
CHARMIAN:
It is well done, and fitting for a princes
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!
DOLABELLA:
How goes it here?
SECOND GUARD:
All dead.
DOLABELLA:
Caesar, thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.
DOLABELLA:
O sir, you are too sure an augurer:
That you did fear is done.
CAESAR:
Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.
DOLABELLA:
Who was last with them?
FIRST GUARD:
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
This was his basket.
CAESAR:
Poison'd then.
FIRST GUARD:
O Caesar,
This Charmian liv'd but now; she stood and spake.
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress. Tremblingly she stood,
And on the sudden dropp'd.
CAESAR:
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.
DOLABELLA:
Here on her breast
There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
The like is on her arm.
FIRST GUARD:
This is an aspic's trail; and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them, such as th' aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile.
CAESAR:
Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
And bear her women from the monument.
She shall be buried by her Antony;
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral,
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
High order in this great solemnity.
ORLANDO:
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
wise remedy how to avoid it.
ADAM:
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ORLANDO:
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
up.
OLIVER:
Now, sir! what make you here?
ORLANDO:
Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
OLIVER:
What mar you then, sir?
ORLANDO:
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
OLIVER:
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
ORLANDO:
Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
OLIVER:
Know you where you are, sir?
ORLANDO:
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
OLIVER:
Know you before whom, sir?
ORLANDO:
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
before me is nearer to his reverence.
OLIVER:
What, boy!
ORLANDO:
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
OLIVER:
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO:
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
ADAM:
[Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
remembrance, be at accord.
OLIVER:
Let me go, I say.
ORLANDO:
I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
my fortunes.
OLIVER:
And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
ORLANDO:
I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER:
Get you with him, you old dog.
ADAM:
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
such a word.
OLIVER:
Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla,
Dennis!
DENNIS:
Calls your worship?
OLIVER:
not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
DENNIS:
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
to you.
OLIVER:
Call him in. 'Twill be a good way; and
to-morrow the wrestling is.
CHARLES:
Good morrow to your worship.
OLIVER:
Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
court?
CHARLES:
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
OLIVER:
Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
with her father?
CHARLES:
O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
OLIVER:
Where will the old Duke live?
CHARLES:
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
OLIVER:
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
CHARLES:
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
OLIVER:
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
CHARLES:
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!
OLIVER:
Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I
hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
thither, which now I'll go about.
CELIA:
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
ROSALIND:
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
extraordinary pleasure.
CELIA:
Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I
could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
as mine is to thee.
ROSALIND:
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
rejoice in yours.
CELIA:
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
Rose, be merry.
ROSALIND:
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
CELIA:
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
ROSALIND:
What shall be our sport, then?
CELIA:
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
ROSALIND:
I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
gifts to women.
CELIA:
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
ill-favouredly.
ROSALIND:
Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
Nature.
CELIA:
No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
the argument?
ROSALIND:
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
CELIA:
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How
now, wit! Whither wander you?
TOUCHSTONE:
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA:
Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE:
No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
ROSALIND:
Where learned you that oath, fool?
TOUCHSTONE:
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
CELIA:
How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
ROSALIND:
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
TOUCHSTONE:
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
by your beards that I am a knave.
CELIA:
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
TOUCHSTONE:
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
that mustard.
CELIA:
Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
TOUCHSTONE:
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
CELIA:
My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
TOUCHSTONE:
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
men do foolishly.
CELIA:
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
ROSALIND:
With his mouth full of news.
CELIA:
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
ROSALIND:
Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
CELIA:
All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
LE BEAU:
Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
CELIA:
Sport! of what colour?
LE BEAU:
What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
ROSALIND:
As wit and fortune will.
TOUCHSTONE:
Or as the Destinies decrees.
CELIA:
Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
TOUCHSTONE:
Nay, if I keep not my rank-
ROSALIND:
Thou losest thy old smell.
LE BEAU:
You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
ROSALIND:
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
LE BEAU:
I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
ladyships, you may see the end
FIRST CITIZEN:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
ALL:
Speak, speak.
FIRST CITIZEN:
YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?
ALL:
Resolv'd, resolv'd.
FIRST CITIZEN:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
people.
ALL:
We know't, we know't.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own
price. Is't a verdict?
ALL:
No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
SECOND CITIZEN:
One word, good citizens.
FIRST CITIZEN:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield
us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess
they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The
leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a
gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
thirst for revenge.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
FIRST CITIZEN:
Against him first; he's a very dog to the
commonalty.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Consider you what services he has done for his
country?
FIRST CITIZEN:
Very well, and could be content to give him good
report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
FIRST CITIZEN:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it
to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it
was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be
partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
SECOND CITIZEN:
What he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
FIRST CITIZEN:
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.

risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!
ALL:
Come, come.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Soft! who comes here?
SECOND CITIZEN:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd
the people.
FIRST CITIZEN:
He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!
MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll
show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;
they shall know we have strong arms too.
MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?
FIRST CITIZEN:
We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
MENENIUS:
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state; whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you; and you slander
The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us
yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with
grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily
any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the
wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear
us.
MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale't a little more.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.
MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-
FIRST CITIZEN:
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-
For look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak- it tauntingly replied
To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Your belly's answer- What?
The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,
With other muniments and petty helps
Is this our fabric, if that they-
MENENIUS:
What then?
Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?
FIRST CITIZEN:
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o' th' body-
MENENIUS:
Well, what then?
FIRST CITIZEN:
The former agents, if they did complain,
What could the belly answer?
MENENIUS:
I will tell you;
If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-
Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Y'are long about it.
MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend:
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live. And though that all at once
You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Ay, sir; well, well.
MENENIUS:
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
FIRST CITIZEN:
It was an answer. How apply you this?
MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for, examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you,
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?
FIRST CITIZEN:
I the great toe? Why the great toe?
MENENIUS:
For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!
MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?
FIRST CITIZEN:
We have ever your good word.
MARCIUS:
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
With every minute you do change a mind
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble Senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
MENENIUS:
For corn at their own rates, whereof they say
The city is well stor'd.
MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know
What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out
Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.
MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?
MARCIUS:
They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them- a strange one,
To break the heart of generosity
And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,
Shouting their emulation.
MENENIUS:
What is granted them?
MARCIUS:
Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.
MENENIUS:
This is strange.
MARCIUS:
Go get you home, you fragments.
MESSENGER:
Where's Caius Marcius?
MARCIUS:
Here. What's the matter?
MESSENGER:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS:
I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
FIRST SENATOR:
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:
The Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
I sin in envying his nobility;
And were I anything but what I am,
I would wish me only he.
COMINIUS:
You have fought together?
MARCIUS:
Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he
Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make
Only my wars with him. He is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.
FIRST SENATOR:
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.
MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? Stand'st out?
LARTIUS:
No, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
Ere stay behind this business.
MENENIUS:
O, true bred!
FIRST SENATOR:
Your company to th' Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.
LARTIUS:
[To COMINIUS]
Right worthy you priority.
COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!
FIRST SENATOR:
[To the Citizens]
MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow.
The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,
Your valour puts well forth; pray follow.
SICINIUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
BRUTUS:
He has no equal.
SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people-
BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
SICINIUS:
Nay, but his taunts!
BRUTUS:
Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
SICINIUS:
Bemock the modest moon.
BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him! He is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon. But I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.
BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims-
In whom already he is well grac'd- cannot
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first; for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To th' utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
Had borne the business!'
SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion, that so sticks on Marcius, shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
BRUTUS:
Come.
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
Though Marcius earn'd them not; and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.
SICINIUS:
Let's hence and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.
BRUTUS:
Let's along.
FIRST SENATOR:
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
And know how we proceed.
AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words- I think
I have the letter here;.yes, here it is:
Whether for east or west. The dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent. Most likely 'tis for you;
Consider of it.'
FIRST SENATOR:
Our army's in the field;
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.
AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery
We shall be short'ned in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.
SECOND SENATOR:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands;
Let us alone to guard Corioli.
If they set down before's, for the remove
Bring up your army; but I think you'll find
Th' have not prepar'd for us.
AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that!
I speak from certainties. Nay more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.
ALL:
The gods assist you!
AUFIDIUS:
And keep your honours safe!
FIRST SENATOR:
Farewell.
SECOND SENATOR:
Farewell.
ALL:
Farewell.
VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more
comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier
rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet
he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth
with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of
kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her
beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person-
that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if
renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I
sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than
now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
VIRGILIA:
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should have been my son; I therein
would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen
sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my
good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
GENTLEWOMAN:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
VIRGILIA:
Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.
VOLUMNIA:
Indeed you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum;
See him pluck Aufidius down by th' hair;
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome.' His bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.
VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!
VOLUMNIA:
Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria
We are fit to bid her welcome.
VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.
VALERIA:
My ladies both, good day to you.
VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam!
VIRGILIA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.
VALERIA:
How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are
you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little
son?
VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
VOLUMNIA:
He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
upon his schoolmaster.
VALERIA:
O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very
pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run
after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go
again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up
again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how
'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he
mammock'd it!
VOLUMNIA:
One on's father's moods.
VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.
VALERIA:
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the
idle huswife with me this afternoon.
VIRGILIA:
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
VALERIA:
Not out of doors!
VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.
VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.
VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you
must go visit the good lady that lies in.
VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my
prayers; but I cannot go thither.
VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?
VIRGILIA:
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn
she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you
might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
VALERIA:
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news
of your husband.
VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him
last night.
VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?
VALERIA:
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it
is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the
general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and
Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli; they
nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
VIRGILIA:
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything
hereafter.
VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease
our better mirth.
VALERIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come,
good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o'
door and go along with us.
VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much
mirth.
VALERIA:
Well then, farewell.
MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.
LARTIUS:
My horse to yours- no.
MARCIUS:
'Tis done.
LARTIUS:
Agreed.
MARCIUS:
Say, has our general met the enemy?
MESSENGER:
They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
LARTIUS:
So, the good horse is mine.
MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.
LARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?
MESSENGER:
Within this mile and half.
MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
FIRST SENATOR:
No, nor a man that fears you less than he:
That's lesser than a little. Hark, our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves. Hark you far off!
There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.
MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!
LARTIUS:
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
MARCIUS:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus.
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.
MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome! you herd of- Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Farther than seen, and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;
If you'll stand fast we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches. Follow me.
So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Fool-hardiness; not I.
SECOND SOLDIER:
Not I.
FIRST SOLDIER:
See, they have shut him in.
ALL:
To th' pot, I warrant him.
LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?
ALL:
Slain, sir, doubtless.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their gates. He is himself alone,
To answer all the city.
LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
Thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Look, sir.
LARTIUS:
O, 'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
FIRST ROMAN:
This will I carry to Rome.
SECOND ROMAN:
And I this.
THIRD ROMAN:
A murrain on 't! I took this for silver.
MARCIUS:
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachma! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.
LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight.
MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me. Fare you well;
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.
LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!
MARCIUS:
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.
LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' th' town,
Where they shall know our mind. Away!
COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
We shall be charg'd again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount'ring,
May give you thankful sacrifice!
Thy news?
MESSENGER:
The citizens of Corioli have issued
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.
COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well. How long is't since?
MESSENGER:
Above an hour, my lord.
COMINIUS:
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?
MESSENGER:
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forc'd to wheel
Three or four miles about; else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.
COMINIUS:
Who's yonder
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have
Before-time seen him thus.
MARCIUS:
Come I too late?
COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.
MARCIUS:
Come I too late?
COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.
MARCIUS:
O! let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward.
COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is't with Titus Lartius?
MARCIUS:
As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death and some to exile;
Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.
COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? Call him hither.
MARCIUS:
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.
COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?
MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?
COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought, and did
Retire to win our purpose.
MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? Know you on which side
They have plac'd their men of trust?
COMINIUS:
As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.
MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts,
We prove this very hour.
COMINIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.
MARCIUS:
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here-
As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.
O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? None of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclin'd.
COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows;
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.
LARTIUS:
So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
For a short holding. If we lose the field
We cannot keep the town.
LIEUTENANT:
Fear not our care, sir.
LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us.
MARCIUS:
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.
AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
MARCIUS:
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!
AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Halloa me like a hare.
MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd. For thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to th' highest.
AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and not valiant, you have sham'd me
In your condemned seconds.
COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou't not believe thy deeds; but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
Where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully din'd before.
LARTIUS:
O General,
Here is the steed, we the caparison.
Hadst thou beheld-
MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more; my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done- that's what I can; induc'd
As you have been- that's for my country.
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.
COMINIUS:
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings and to silence that
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you,
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done, before our army hear me.
MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves rememb'red.
COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth
Before the common distribution at
Your only choice.
MARCIUS:
I thank you, General,
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.
May these same instruments which you profane
Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
I' th' field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-fac'd soothing. When steel grows
Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made
An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled,
Or foil'd some debile wretch, which without note
Here's many else have done, you shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical,
As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
In praises sauc'd with lies.
COMINIUS:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly. By your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd, we'll put you-
Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland; in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, can him
With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,
Caius Marcius Coriolanus.
Bear th' addition nobly ever!
ALL:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
CORIOLANUS:
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you;
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To th' fairness of my power.
COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back. Send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate
For their own good and ours.
LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord.
CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refus'd most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my Lord General.
COMINIUS:
Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?
CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he us'd me kindly.
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
To give my poor host freedom.
COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?
CORIOLANUS:
By Jupiter, forgot!
I am weary; yea, my memory is tir'd.
Have we no wine here?
COMINIUS:
Go we to our tent.
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to. Come.
AUFIDIUS:
The town is ta'en.
FIRST SOLDIER:
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
AUFIDIUS:
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
What good condition can a treaty find
I' th' part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By th' elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine or I am his. Mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
Or wrath or craft may get him.
FIRST SOLDIER:
He's the devil.
AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suff'ring stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius. Where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to th' city;
Learn how 'tis held, and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Will not you go?
AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you-
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.
FIRST SOLDIER:
I shall, sir.
MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
BRUTUS:
Good or bad?
MENENIUS:
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love
not Marcius.
SICINIUS:
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
MENENIUS:
Pray you, who does the wolf love?
SICINIUS:
The lamb.
MENENIUS:
Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius.
BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
MENENIUS:
He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are
old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
BOTH TRIBUNES:
Well, sir.
MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
in abundance?
BRUTUS:
He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.
SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.
BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.
MENENIUS:
This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured
here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you?
BOTH TRIBUNES:
Why, how are we censur'd?
MENENIUS:
Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?
BOTH TRIBUNES:
Well, well, sir, well.
MENENIUS:
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your
dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the
least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame
Marcius for being proud?
BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.
MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are
many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your
abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of
pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
that you could!
BOTH TRIBUNES:
What then, sir?
MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.
SICINIUS:
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
MENENIUS:
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves
a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to
be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty
and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you
Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I
make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have
deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with
the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to
bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie
deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the
map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?
What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
character, if I be known well enough too?
BRUTUS:
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are
ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good
wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and
a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter
between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the
colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag
against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss
the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All
the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
MENENIUS:
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak
best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your
beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a
cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;
though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation
would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.
How now, my as fair as noble ladies- and the moon, were she
earthly, no nobler- whither do you follow your eyes so fast?
VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the
love of Juno, let's go.
MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home?
VOLUMNIA:
Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous
approbation.
MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!
VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another,
his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you.
MENENIUS:
I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?
VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
MENENIUS:
A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'
health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The
most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to
this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no.
VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in
his pocket? The wounds become him.
VOLUMNIA:
On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with
the oaken garland.
MENENIUS:
Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?
VOLUMNIA:
Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius
got off.
MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he
had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate
possess'd of this?
VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has
letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name
of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
doubly.
VALERIA:
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
MENENIUS:
Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true
purchasing.
VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!
VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, waw.
MENENIUS:
True! I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?
home; he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
VOLUMNIA:
I' th' shoulder and i' th' left arm; there will be large
cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i' th' body.
MENENIUS:
One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I
know.
VOLUMNIA:
He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds
upon him.
MENENIUS:
Now it's twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy's grave.
VOLUMNIA:
These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.
HERALD:
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates, where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
ALL:
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
CORIOLANUS:
No more of this, it does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!
CORIOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly nam'd-
What is it? Coriolanus must I can thee?
But, O, thy wife!
CORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.
MENENIUS:
Now the gods crown thee!
CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet? O my sweet lady,
pardon.
VOLUMNIA:
I know not where to turn.
O, welcome home! And welcome, General.
And y'are welcome all.
MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
A curse begin at very root on's heart
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors.
We call a nettle but a nettle, and
The faults of fools but folly.
COMINIUS:
Ever right.
CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever, ever.
HERALD:
Give way there, and go on.
CORIOLANUS:
[To his wife and mother]
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings,
But with them change of honours.
VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes,
And the buildings of my fancy; only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs.
COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol.
BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clamb'ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station; our veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely gawded cheeks to th' wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses. Such a pother,
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers,
And gave him graceful posture.
SICINIUS:
On the sudden
I warrant him consul.
BRUTUS:
Then our office may
During his power go sleep.
SICINIUS:
He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.
BRUTUS:
In that there's comfort.
SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours; which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.
BRUTUS:
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' th' market-place, nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To th' people, beg their stinking breaths.
SICINIUS:
'Tis right.
BRUTUS:
It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.
SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose, and to put it
In execution.
BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he will.
SICINIUS:
It shall be to him then as our good wills:
A sure destruction.
BRUTUS:
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders, and
Dispropertied their freedoms; holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.
SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people- which time shall not want,
If he be put upon't, and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.
BRUTUS:
What's the matter?
MESSENGER:
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to hear him speak; matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd; the nobles bended
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol,
And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
But hearts for the event.
SICINIUS:
Have with you.
FIRST OFFICER:
Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for
consulships?
SECOND OFFICER:
Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus will carry it.
FIRST OFFICER:
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and
loves not the common people.
SECOND OFFICER:
Faith, there have been many great men that have
flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many
that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they
love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.
Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
see't.
FIRST OFFICER:
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to
flatter them for their love.
SECOND OFFICER:
He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been
supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further
deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but
he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof
and rebuke from every car that heard it.
FIRST OFFICER:
No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they
are coming.
MENENIUS:
Having determin'd of the Volsces, and
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country. Therefore please you,
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present consul and last general
In our well-found successes to report
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus; whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.
FIRST SENATOR:
Speak, good Cominius.
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out. Masters o' th' people,
We do request your kindest ears; and, after,
Your loving motion toward the common body,
To yield what passes here.
SICINIUS:
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.
BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be bless'd to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto priz'd them at.
MENENIUS:
That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?
BRUTUS:
Most willingly.
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.
MENENIUS:
He loves your people;
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.
FIRST SENATOR:
Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.
CORIOLANUS:
Your Honours' pardon.
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.
BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.
CORIOLANUS:
No, sir; yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You sooth'd not, therefore hurt not. But your people,
I love them as they weigh-
MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.
CORIOLANUS:
I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.
MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-
That's thousand to one good one- when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
COMINIUS:
I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue and
Most dignifies the haver. If it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him; he bestrid
An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say
I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red
The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd
Both field and city ours he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.
MENENIUS:
Worthy man!
FIRST SENATOR:
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.
COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world. He covets less
Than misery itself would give, rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.
MENENIUS:
He's right noble;
Let him be call'd for.
FIRST SENATOR:
Call Coriolanus.
OFFICER. He doth appear.
MENENIUS:
The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd
To make thee consul.
CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still
My life and services.
MENENIUS:
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.
CORIOLANUS:
I do beseech you
Let me o'erleap that custom; for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them
For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you
That I may pass this doing.
SICINIUS:
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.
MENENIUS:
Put them not to't.
Pray you go fit you to the custom, and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.
CORIOLANUS:
It is a part
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.
BRUTUS:
Mark you that?
CORIOLANUS:
To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!'
Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
Of their breath only!
MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, Tribunes of the People,
Our purpose to them; and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.
SENATORS:
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the people.
SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.
BRUTUS:
Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here. On th' market-place
I know they do attend us.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to
deny him.
SECOND CITIZEN:
We may, sir, if we will.
THIRD CITIZEN:
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds
and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those
wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we
must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should
bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
FIRST CITIZEN:
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck
not to call us the many-headed multitude.
THIRD CITIZEN:
We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads
are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our
wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits
were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north,
south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
all the points o' th' compass.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?
THIRD CITIZEN:
Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at
liberty 'twould sure southward.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Why that way?
THIRD CITIZEN:
To lose itself in a fog; where being three parts
conscience' sake, to help to get thee a wife.
SECOND CITIZEN:
YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you
may.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Are you all resolv'd to give your voices? But that's
no matter, the greater part carries it. I say, if he would
incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behaviour.
We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he
stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He's to make his
requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues;
therefore follow me, and I'll direct you how you shall go by him.
ALL:
Content, content.
MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right; have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?
CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I pray, sir'- Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace. 'Look, sir, my wounds
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From th' noise of our own drums.'
MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that. You must desire them
To think upon you.
CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me? Hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.
MENENIUS:
You'll mar all.
I'll leave you. Pray you speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.
CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.
THIRD CITIZEN:
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Your own desert?
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, not mine own desire.
THIRD CITIZEN:
How, not your own desire?
CORIOLANUS:
No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
with begging.
THIRD CITIZEN:
YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to
gain by you.
CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
FIRST CITIZEN:
The price is to ask it kindly.
CORIOLANUS:
Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show
you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what
say you?
SECOND CITIZEN:
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices begg'd.
I have your alms. Adieu.
THIRD CITIZEN:
But this is something odd.
SECOND CITIZEN:
An 'twere to give again- but 'tis no matter.
CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly.
CORIOLANUS:
Your enigma?
FOURTH CITIZEN:
You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have
been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common
people.
CORIOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous, that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn
brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a
condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their
choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That
is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I
may be consul.
FIFTH CITIZEN:
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
You have received many wounds for your country.
CORIOLANUS:
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.
BOTH CITIZENS:
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't.
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
For truth to o'erpeer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through:
The one part suffered, the other will I do.
Here come moe voices.
Your voices. For your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices?
Indeed, I would be consul.
SIXTH CITIZEN:
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
man's voice.
SEVENTH CITIZEN:
Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him
joy, and make him good friend to the people!
ALL:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!
MENENIUS:
You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice. Remains
That, in th' official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the Senate.
CORIOLANUS:
Is this done?
SICINIUS:
The custom of request you have discharg'd.
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
CORIOLANUS:
Where? At the Senate House?
SICINIUS:
There, Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS:
May I change these garments?
SICINIUS:
You may, sir.
CORIOLANUS:
That I'll straight do, and, knowing myself again,
Repair to th' Senate House.
MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along?
BRUTUS:
We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He has it now; and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at's heart.
BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore
His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?
SICINIUS:
How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
FIRST CITIZEN:
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS:
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Certainly;
He flouted us downright.
FIRST CITIZEN:
No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He us'd us scornfully. He should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds receiv'd for's country.
SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.
ALL:
No, no; no man saw 'em.
THIRD CITIZEN:
He said he had wounds which he could show in
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he; 'aged custom
But by your voices will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices. Thank you,
Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
SICINIUS:
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?
BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him-
As you were lesson'd- when he had no power
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy; ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices, and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.
SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advis'd, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught. So, putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.
BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves; and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?
SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere now denied the asker, and now again,
Of him that did not ask but mock, bestow
Your su'd-for tongues?
THIRD CITIZEN:
He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
SECOND CITIZENS:
And will deny him;
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
FIRST CITIZEN:
I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece
'em.
BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties, make them of no more voice
Than dogs, that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.
SICINIUS:
Let them assemble;
And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed;
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
Th' apprehension of his present portance,
Which, most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.
SICINIUS:
Say you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections; and that your minds,
Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.
BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued; and what stock he springs of-
The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our best water brought by conduits hither;
And Censorinus, nobly named so,
Twice being by the people chosen censor,
Was his great ancestor.
SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances; but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.
BRUTUS:
Say you ne'er had done't-
Harp on that still- but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to th' Capitol.
CITIZENS:
will will so; almost all
Repent in their election.
BRUTUS:
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay, past doubt, for greater.
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.
SICINIUS:
To th' Capitol, come.
We will be there before the stream o' th' people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.
CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
LARTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that it was which caus'd
Our swifter composition.
CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
Upon's again.
COMINIUS:
They are worn, Lord Consul, so
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.
CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?
LARTIUS:
On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium.
CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?
LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.
CORIOLANUS:
How? What?
LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.
CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?
LARTIUS:
At Antium.
CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them,
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.
SICINIUS:
Pass no further.
CORIOLANUS:
Ha! What is that?
BRUTUS:
It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
CORIOLANUS:
What makes this change?
MENENIUS:
The matter?
COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.
CORIOLANUS:
Have I had children's voices?
FIRST SENATOR:
Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
BRUTUS:
The people are incens'd against him.
SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.
CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?
MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.
CORIOLANUS:
It is a purpos'd thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility;
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be rul'd.
BRUTUS:
Call't not a plot.
The people cry you mock'd them; and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repin'd;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.
BRUTUS:
Not to them all.
CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?
BRUTUS:
How? I inform them!
COMINIUS:
You are like to do such business.
BRUTUS:
Not unlike
Each way to better yours.
CORIOLANUS:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.
SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
For which the people stir; if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.
MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.
COMINIUS:
The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring
Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' th' plain way of his merit.
CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again-
MENENIUS:
Not now, not now.
FIRST SENATOR:
Not in this heat, sir, now.
CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves. I say again,
In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.
MENENIUS:
Well, no more.
FIRST SENATOR:
No more words, we beseech you.
CORIOLANUS:
How? no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles
Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.
BRUTUS:
You speak o' th' people
As if you were a god, to punish; not
A man of their infirmity.
SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the people know't.
MENENIUS:
What, what? his choler?
CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.
CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
His absolute 'shall'?
COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.
CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power,
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators; and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,
It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by th' other.
COMINIUS:
Well, on to th' market-place.
CORIOLANUS:
Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd
Sometime in Greece-
MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of that.
CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-
I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.
BRUTUS:
Why shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?
CORIOLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd
They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation
Which they have often made against the Senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the native
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bosom multiplied digest
The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats, and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.
MENENIUS:
Come, enough.
BRUTUS:
Enough, with over measure.
CORIOLANUS:
No, take more.
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance- it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-
You that will be less fearful than discreet;
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For th' ill which doth control't.
BRUTUS:
Has said enough.
SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
As traitors do.
CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes,
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench? In a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen; in a better hour
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' th' dust.
BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!
SICINIUS:
This a consul? No.
BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.
SICINIUS:
Go call the people, in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.
CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!
PATRICIANS:
We'll surety him.
COMINIUS:
Ag'd sir, hands off.
CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.
SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!
MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS:
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS:
Seize him, aediles.
PLEBEIANS. Down with him! down with him!
SECOND SENATOR:
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
ALL:
Tribunes! patricians! citizens! What, ho! Sicinius!
Brutus! Coriolanus! Citizens!
PATRICIANS:
Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!
MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You tribunes
To th' people- Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.
SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!
PLEBEIANS:
Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties.
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have nam'd for consul.
MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
FIRST SENATOR:
To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?
PLEBEIANS:
True,
The people are the city.
BRUTUS:
By the consent of all we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.
PLEBEIANS:
You so remain.
MENENIUS:
And so are like to do.
COMINIUS:
That is the way to lay the city flat,
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
In heaps and piles of ruin.
SICINIUS:
This deserves death.
BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our authority
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power
We were elected theirs: Marcius is worthy
Of present death.
SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.
BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him.
PLEBEIANS:
Yield, Marcius, yield.
MENENIUS:
Hear me one word; beseech you, Tribunes,
Hear me but a word.
AEDILES:
Peace, peace!
MENENIUS:
Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
And temp'rately proceed to what you would
Thus violently redress.
BRUTUS:
Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him
And bear him to the rock.
CORIOLANUS:
No: I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting;
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
MENENIUS:
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
BRUTUS:
Lay hands upon him.
MENENIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old.
PLEBEIANS:
Down with him, down with him!
MENENIUS:
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away.
All will be nought else.
SECOND SENATOR:
Get you gone.
CORIOLANUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.
MENENIUS:
Shall it be put to that?
FIRST SENATOR:
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us to cure this cause.
MENENIUS:
For 'tis a sore upon us
You cannot tent yourself; be gone, beseech you.
COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along with us.
CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians, as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd; not Romans, as they are not,
Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol.
MENENIUS:
Be gone.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.
CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.
MENENIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes.
COMINIUS:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,
And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters, and o'erbear
What they are us'd to bear.
MENENIUS:
Pray you be gone.
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little; this must be patch'd
With cloth of any colour.
COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.
PATRICIANS:
This man has marr'd his fortune.
MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!
PATRICIANS:
I would they were a-bed.
MENENIUS:
I would they were in Tiber.
What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?
SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?
MENENIUS:
You worthy Tribunes-
SICINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands; he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power,
Which he so sets at nought.
FIRST CITIZEN:
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.
PLEBEIANS:
He shall, sure on't.
MENENIUS:
Sir, sir-
SICINIUS:
Peace!
MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant.
SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?
MENENIUS:
Hear me speak.
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults.
SICINIUS:
Consul! What consul?
MENENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.
BRUTUS:
He consul!
PLEBEIANS:
No, no, no, no, no.
MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.
SICINIUS:
Speak briefly, then,
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor; to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.
MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!
SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut away.
MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a disease-
Mortal, to cut it off: to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country
Were to us all that do't and suffer it
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.
BRUTUS:
Merely awry. When he did love his country,
It honour'd him.
SICINIUS:
The service of the foot,
Being once gangren'd, is not then respected
For what before it was.
BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.
MENENIUS:
One word more, one word
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,
Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.
BRUTUS:
If it were so-
SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience-
Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come!
MENENIUS:
Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars
Since 'a could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.
FIRST SENATOR:
Noble Tribunes,
It is the humane way; the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the King's.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
But what's the matter?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
He purpos'd to his wife's sole son- a widow
That late he married- hath referr'd herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded;
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd. All
Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
Be touch'd at very heart.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
None but the King?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,
That most desir'd the match. But not a courtier,
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
And why so?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her-
I mean that married her, alack, good man!
And therefore banish'd- is a creature such
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like, there would be something failing
In him that should compare. I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
You speak him far.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I do extend him, sir, within himself;
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
What's his name and birth?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I cannot delve him to the root; his father
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons, who, in the wars o' th' time,
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being; and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas'd
As he was born. The King he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,
And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-
Which rare it is to do- most prais'd, most lov'd,
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
For whom he now is banish'd- her own price
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I honour him
Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
Is she sole child to th' King?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
His only child.
He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing,
Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old,
I' th' swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stol'n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
How long is this ago?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Some twenty years.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
That a king's children should be so convey'd,
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow
That could not trace them!
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
Yet is it true, sir.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I do well believe you.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
The Queen, and Princess.
QUEEN:
No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
After the slander of most stepmothers,
Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
So soon as I can win th' offended King,
I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.
POSTHUMUS:
Please your Highness,
I will from hence to-day.
QUEEN:
You know the peril.
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King
Hath charg'd you should not speak together.
IMOGEN:
O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing-
Always reserv'd my holy duty- what
His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.
POSTHUMUS:
My queen! my mistress!
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth;
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
Who to my father was a friend, to me
Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
Though ink be made of gall.
QUEEN:
Be brief, I pray you.
If the King come, I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure. Yet I'll move him
To walk this way. I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
Pays dear for my offences.
POSTHUMUS:
Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live,
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
IMOGEN:
Nay, stay a little.
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:
This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart;
But keep it till you woo another wife,
When Imogen is dead.
POSTHUMUS:
How, how? Another?
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
As I my poor self did exchange for you,
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
I still win of you. For my sake wear this;
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
Upon this fairest prisoner.
IMOGEN:
O the gods!
When shall we see again?
POSTHUMUS:
Alack, the King!
CYMBELINE:
Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
Thou'rt poison to my blood.
POSTHUMUS:
The gods protect you,
And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.
IMOGEN:
There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is.
CYMBELINE:
O disloyal thing,
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
A year's age on me!
IMOGEN:
I beseech you, sir,
Harm not yourself with your vexation.
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs, all fears.
CYMBELINE:
Past grace? obedience?
IMOGEN:
Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.
CYMBELINE:
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
IMOGEN:
O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle,
And did avoid a puttock.
CYMBELINE:
Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness.
IMOGEN:
No; I rather added
A lustre to it.
CYMBELINE:
O thou vile one!
IMOGEN:
Sir,
It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays.
CYMBELINE:
What, art thou mad?
IMOGEN:
Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherd's son!
CYMBELINE:
Thou foolish thing!
Not after our command. Away with her,
And pen her up.
QUEEN:
Beseech your patience.- Peace,
Dear lady daughter, peace!- Sweet sovereign,
Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
Out of your best advice.
CYMBELINE:
Nay, let her languish
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
Die of this folly.
QUEEN:
Fie! you must give way.
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
PISANIO:
My lord your son drew on my master.
QUEEN:
Ha!
No harm, I trust, is done?
PISANIO:
There might have been,
But that my master rather play'd than fought,
And had no help of anger; they were parted
By gentlemen at hand.
QUEEN:
I am very glad on't.
IMOGEN:
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together;
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
PISANIO:
On his command. He would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven; left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to,
When't pleas'd you to employ me.
QUEEN:
This hath been
Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so.
PISANIO:
I humbly thank your Highness.
QUEEN:
Pray walk awhile.
IMOGEN:
About some half-hour hence,
Pray you speak with me. You shall at least
Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.
FIRST LORD:
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence
of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out,
air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
CLOTEN:
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
FIRST LORD:
Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not
hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back
side the town.
CLOTEN:
The villain would not stand me.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your
face.
FIRST LORD:
Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he
added to your having, gave you some ground.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans.
Puppies!
CLOTEN:
I would they had not come between us.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a
fool you were upon the ground.
CLOTEN:
And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is
damn'd.
FIRST LORD:
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection
of her wit.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection
should hurt her.
CLOTEN:
Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt
done!
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of
an ass, which is no great hurt.
CLOTEN:
You'll go with us?
FIRST LORD:
I'll attend your lordship.
CLOTEN:
Nay, come, let's go together.
SECOND LORD:
Well, my lord.
IMOGEN:
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' th' haven,
And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
That he spake to thee?
PISANIO:
It was: his queen, his queen!
IMOGEN:
Then wav'd his handkerchief?
PISANIO:
And kiss'd it, madam.
IMOGEN:
Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
And that was all?
PISANIO:
No, madam; for so long
As he could make me with his eye, or care
Distinguish him from others, he did keep
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
How swift his ship.
IMOGEN:
Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow, or less, ere left
To after-eye him.
PISANIO:
Madam, so I did.
IMOGEN:
I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack'd them but
To look upon him, till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
Nay, followed him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
When shall we hear from him?
PISANIO:
Be assur'd, madam,
With his next vantage.
IMOGEN:
I did not take my leave of him, but had
Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour; or have charg'd him,
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
T' encounter me with orisons, for then
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing.
LADY:
The Queen, madam,
Desires your Highness' company.
IMOGEN:
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
I will attend the Queen.
PISANIO:
Madam, I shall.
IACHIMO:
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then
of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
been allowed the name of. But I could then have look'd on him
without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his
endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by
items.
PHILARIO:
You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
is with that which makes him both without and within.
FRENCHMAN:
I have seen him in France; we had very many there could
behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
IACHIMO:
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he
must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I
doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
FRENCHMAN:
And then his banishment.
IACHIMO:
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it
but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay
flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it
he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
PHILARIO:
His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have
been often bound for no less than my life.
Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as
suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman,
whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is
I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his
own hearing.
FRENCHMAN:
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
POSTHUMUS:
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
FRENCHMAN:
Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did
atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have
been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,
upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.
POSTHUMUS:
By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller;
rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every
action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended
judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not
altogether slight.
FRENCHMAN:
Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and
by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
other or have fall'n both.
IACHIMO:
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
FRENCHMAN:
Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which
may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like
an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in
praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more
fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less
attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
IACHIMO:
That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion,
by this, worn out.
POSTHUMUS:
She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
IACHIMO:
You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
POSTHUMUS:
Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate
her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
IACHIMO:
As fair and as good- a kind of hand-in-hand comparison-
had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain.
If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours
outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she
excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that
is, nor you the lady.
POSTHUMUS:
I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
IACHIMO:
What do you esteem it at?
POSTHUMUS:
More than the world enjoys.
IACHIMO:
Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's
outpriz'd by a trifle.
POSTHUMUS:
You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there
were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the
other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
IACHIMO:
Which the gods have given you?
POSTHUMUS:
Which by their graces I will keep.
IACHIMO:
You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl
light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So
your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and
the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish'd
courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
POSTHUMUS:
Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of
that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of
thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
PHILARIO:
Let us leave here, gentlemen.
POSTHUMUS:
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank
him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
IACHIMO:
With five times so much conversation I should get ground
of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had
I admittance and opportunity to friend.
POSTHUMUS:
No, no.
IACHIMO:
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make
my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and,
to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
lady in the world.
POSTHUMUS:
You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion,
and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt.
IACHIMO:
What's that?
POSTHUMUS:
A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve
more- a punishment too.
PHILARIO:
Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let
it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.
IACHIMO:
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
approbation of what I have spoke!
POSTHUMUS:
What lady would you choose to assail?
IACHIMO:
Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will
lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the
court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the
opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd.
POSTHUMUS:
I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I
hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
IACHIMO:
You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy
ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from
tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
POSTHUMUS:
This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver
purpose, I hope.
IACHIMO:
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's
spoken, I swear.
POSTHUMUS:
Will you? I Shall but lend my diamond till your return.
Let there be covenants drawn between's. My mistress exceeds in
goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to
this match: here's my ring.
PHILARIO:
I will have it no lay.
IACHIMO:
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient
testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your
mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond
too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have
trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours-
provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.
POSTHUMUS:
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt
us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon
her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am
no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain
unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill
opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall
answer me with your sword.
IACHIMO:
Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down
by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the
bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and
have our two wagers recorded.
POSTHUMUS:
Agreed.
FRENCHMAN:
Will this hold, think you?
PHILARIO:
Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow 'em.
QUEEN:
Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
Make haste; who has the note of them?
LADY:
I, madam.
QUEEN:
Dispatch.
Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?
CORNELIUS:
Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
But I beseech your Grace, without offence-
My conscience bids me ask- wherefore you have
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
Which are the movers of a languishing death,
But, though slow, deadly?
QUEEN:
I wonder, Doctor,
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded-
Unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet
That I did amplify my judgment in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging- but none human-
To try the vigour of them, and apply
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects.
CORNELIUS:
Your Highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
Besides, the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious.
QUEEN:
O, content thee.
Will I first work. He's for his master,
An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!
Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
Take your own way.
CORNELIUS:
[Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
But you shall do no harm.
QUEEN:
[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
CORNELIUS:
[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs,
Then afterward up higher; but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes,
More than the locking up the spirits a time,
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
With a most false effect; and I the truer
So to be false with her.
QUEEN:
No further service, Doctor,
Until I send for thee.
CORNELIUS:
I humbly take my leave.
QUEEN:
Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
She will not quench, and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master; greater, for
His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
Continue where he is. To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another,
And every day that comes comes comes to
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
To be depender on a thing that leans,
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
So much as but to prop him?
Thou tak'st up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.
It is a thing I made, which hath the King
Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know
What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it;
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on; but think
Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
To any shape of thy preferment, such
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
Think on my words.
A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
Of leigers for her sweet; and which she after,
Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
To taste of too.
So, so. Well done, well done.
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
Think on my words.
PISANIO:
And shall do.
But when to my good lord I prove untrue
I'll choke myself- there's all I'll do for you.
IMOGEN:
A father cruel and a step-dame false;
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
That hath her husband banish'd. O, that husband!
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
PISANIO:
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
Comes from my lord with letters.
IACHIMO:
Change you, madam?
The worthy Leonatus is in safety,
And greets your Highness dearly.
IMOGEN:
Thanks, good sir.
You're kindly welcome.
IACHIMO:
[Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
She is alone th' Arabian bird, and I
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
Rather, directly fly.
IMOGEN:
[Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him
accordingly, as you value your trust.
So far I read aloud;
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warm'd by th' rest and takes it thankfully.
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
Have words to bid you; and shall find it so
In all that I can do.
IACHIMO:
Thanks, fairest lady.
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
Upon the number'd beach, and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
'Twixt fair and foul?
IMOGEN:
What makes your admiration?
IACHIMO:
It cannot be i' th' eye, for apes and monkeys,
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' th' judgment,
For idiots in this case of favour would
Be wisely definite; nor i' th' appetite;
Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos'd,
Should make desire vomit emptiness,
Not so allur'd to feed.
IMOGEN:
What is the matter, trow?
IACHIMO:
The cloyed will-
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
Both fill'd and running- ravening first the lamb,
Longs after for the garbage.
IMOGEN:
What, dear sir,
Thus raps you? Are you well?
IACHIMO:
Thanks, madam; well.- Beseech you, sir,
Desire my man's abode where I did leave him.
He's strange and peevish.
PISANIO:
I was going, sir,
To give him welcome.
IMOGEN:
Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?
IACHIMO:
Well, madam.
IMOGEN:
Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.
IACHIMO:
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd
The Britain reveller.
IMOGEN:
When he was here
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
Not knowing why.
IACHIMO:
I never saw him sad.
There is a Frenchman his companion, one
An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton-
Your lord, I mean- laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
Can my sides hold, to think that man- who knows
By history, report, or his own proof,
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
But must be- will's free hours languish for
Assured bondage?'
IMOGEN:
Will my lord say so?
IACHIMO:
Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
Some men are much to blame.
IMOGEN:
Not he, I hope.
IACHIMO:
Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
Be us'd more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
To pity too.
IMOGEN:
What do you pity, sir?
IACHIMO:
Two creatures heartily.
IMOGEN:
Am I one, sir?
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity?
IACHIMO:
Lamentable! What,
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
I' th' dungeon by a snuff?
IMOGEN:
I pray you, sir,
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands. Why do you pity me?
IACHIMO:
That others do,
I was about to say, enjoy your- But
It is an office of the gods to venge it,
Not mine to speak on't.
IMOGEN:
You do seem to know
Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you-
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do; for certainties
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
The remedy then born- discover to me
What both you spur and stop.
IACHIMO:
Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
To th' oath of loyalty; this object, which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehood- falsehood as
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
Base and illustrious as the smoky light
That's fed with stinking tallow- it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt.
IMOGEN:
My lord, I fear,
Has forgot Britain.
IACHIMO:
And himself. Not I
Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out.
IMOGEN:
Let me hear no more.
IACHIMO:
O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick! A lady
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
Would make the great'st king double, to be partner'd
With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Recoil from your great stock.
IMOGEN:
Reveng'd?
How should I be reveng'd? If this be true-
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse- if it be true,
How should I be reveng'd?
IACHIMO:
Should he make me
Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets,
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
More noble than that runagate to your bed,
And will continue fast to your affection,
Still close as sure.
IMOGEN:
What ho, Pisanio!
IACHIMO:
Let me my service tender on your lips.
IMOGEN:
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek'st, as base as strange.
Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour; and
Solicits here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike.- What ho, Pisanio!-
The King my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew, and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for, and a daughter who
He not respects at all.- What ho, Pisanio!
IACHIMO:
O happy Leonatus! I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long,
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord
That which he is new o'er; and he is one
The truest manner'd, such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him,
Half all men's hearts are his.
IMOGEN:
You make amends.
IACHIMO:
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
He hath a kind of honour sets him of
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur'd
To try your taking of a false report, which hath
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
In the election of a sir so rare,
Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.
IMOGEN:
All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours.
IACHIMO:
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
T' entreat your Grace but in a small request,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business.
IMOGEN:
Pray what is't?
IACHIMO:
Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord-
The best feather of our wing- have mingled sums
To buy a present for the Emperor;
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
To take them in protection?
IMOGEN:
Willingly;
And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber.
IACHIMO:
They are in a trunk,
Attended by my men. I will make bold
To send them to you only for this night;
I must aboard to-morrow.
IMOGEN:
O, no, no.
IACHIMO:
Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
By length'ning my return. From Gallia
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your Grace.
IMOGEN:
I thank you for your pains.
But not away to-morrow!
IACHIMO:
O, I must, madam.
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night.
I have outstood my time, which is material
'To th' tender of our present.
IMOGEN:
I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.
CLOTEN:
Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and
then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my
pleasure.
FIRST LORD:
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your
bowl.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it
would have run all out.
CLOTEN:
When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any
standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha?
SECOND LORD:
No, my lord; nor crop the ears of them.
CLOTEN:
Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been
one of my rank!
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
CLOTEN:
I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I
had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me,
because of the Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful
of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody
can match.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
cock, with your comb on.
CLOTEN:
Sayest thou?
SECOND LORD:
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to.
CLOTEN:
No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to
my inferiors.
SECOND LORD:
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
CLOTEN:
Why, so I say.
FIRST LORD:
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court
to-night?
CLOTEN:
A stranger, and I not known on't?
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
not.
FIRST LORD:
There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of
Leonatus' friends.
CLOTEN:
Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever
he be. Who told you of this stranger?
FIRST LORD:
One of your lordship's pages.
CLOTEN:
Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation
in't?
SECOND LORD:
You cannot derogate, my lord.
CLOTEN:
Not easily, I think.
SECOND LORD:
[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues,
being foolish, do not derogate.
CLOTEN:
Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at
bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
SECOND LORD:
I'll attend your lordship.
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
T' enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
IMOGEN:
Who's there? My woman? Helen?
LADY:
Please you, madam.
IMOGEN:
What hour is it?
LADY:
Almost midnight, madam.
IMOGEN:
I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak;
Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly.
To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me, beseech ye!
IACHIMO:
The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' th' taper
Bows toward her and would under-peep her lids
To see th' enclosed lights, now canopied
Under these windows white and azure, lac'd
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design
To note the chamber. I will write all down:
Such and such pictures; there the window; such
Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures-
Why, such and such; and the contents o' th' story.
Ah, but some natural notes about her body
Above ten thousand meaner movables
Would testify, t' enrich mine inventory.
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
And be her sense but as a monument,
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
As strongly as the conscience does within,
To th' madding of her lord. On her left breast
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
I' th' bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher
Stronger than ever law could make; this secret
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
Why should I write this down that's riveted,
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
To th' trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
One, two, three. Time, time!
FIRST LORD:
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
CLOTEN:
It would make any man cold to lose.
FIRST LORD:
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
CLOTEN:
Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this
foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning,
is't not?
FIRST LORD:
Day, my lord.
CLOTEN:
I would this music would come. I am advised to give her
music a mornings; they say it will penetrate.
Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so.
We'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but
I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited
thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to
it- and then let her consider.
So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music
the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which
horsehairs and calves' guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
boot, can never amend.
SECOND LORD:
Here comes the King.
CLOTEN:
I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up
so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done
fatherly.- Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother.
CYMBELINE:
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
Will she not forth?
CLOTEN:
I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no
notice.
CYMBELINE:
The exile of her minion is too new;
She hath not yet forgot him; some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
And then she's yours.
QUEEN:
You are most bound to th' King,
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting, and be friended
With aptness of the season; make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspir'd to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
Save when command to your dismission tends,
And therein you are senseless.
CLOTEN:
Senseless? Not so.
MESSENGER:
So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
The one is Caius Lucius.
CYMBELINE:
A worthy fellow,
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
But that's no fault of his. We must receive him
According to the honour of his sender;
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
When you have given good morning to your mistress,
Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need
T' employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
CLOTEN:
If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!
I know her women are about her; what
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
Which buys admittance; oft it doth-yea, and makes
Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
Their deer to th' stand o' th' stealer; and 'tis gold
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What
Can it not do and undo? I will make
One of her women lawyer to me, for
I yet not understand the case myself.
By your leave.
LADY:
Who's there that knocks?
CLOTEN:
A gentleman.
LADY:
No more?
CLOTEN:
Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
LADY:
That's more
Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
CLOTEN:
Your lady's person; is she ready?
LADY:
Ay,
To keep her chamber.
CLOTEN:
There is gold for you; sell me your good report.
LADY:
How? My good name? or to report of you
What I shall think is good? The Princess!
CLOTEN:
Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.
IMOGEN:
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
And scarce can spare them.
CLOTEN:
Still I swear I love you.
IMOGEN:
If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.
If you swear still, your recompense is still
That I regard it not.
CLOTEN:
This is no answer.
IMOGEN:
But that you shall not say I yield, being silent,
I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness; one of your great knowing
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
CLOTEN:
To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin;
I will not.
IMOGEN:
Fools are not mad folks.
CLOTEN:
Do you call me fool?
IMOGEN:
As I am mad, I do;
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
You put me to forget a lady's manners
By being so verbal; and learn now, for all,
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
By th' very truth of it, I care not for you,
And am so near the lack of charity
To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather
You felt than make't my boast.
CLOTEN:
You sin against
Obedience, which you owe your father. For
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
With scraps o' th' court- it is no contract, none.
And though it be allowed in meaner parties-
Yet who than he more mean?- to knit their souls-
On whom there is no more dependency
But brats and beggary- in self-figur'd knot,
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
The consequence o' th' crown, and must not foil
The precious note of it with a base slave,
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
IMOGEN:
Profane fellow!
Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
For being preferr'd so well.
CLOTEN:
The south fog rot him!
IMOGEN:
He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st garment
That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
CLOTEN:
'His garments'! Now the devil-
IMOGEN:
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.
CLOTEN:
'His garment'!
IMOGEN:
I am sprited with a fool;
Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's; shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe! I do think
I saw't this morning; confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.
PISANIO:
'Twill not be lost.
IMOGEN:
I hope so. Go and search.
CLOTEN:
You have abus'd me.
'His meanest garment'!
IMOGEN:
Ay, I said so, sir.
If you will make 't an action, call witness to 't.
CLOTEN:
I will inform your father.
IMOGEN:
Your mother too.
She's my good lady and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,
To th' worst of discontent.
CLOTEN:
I'll be reveng'd.
'His mean'st garment'! Well.
POSTHUMUS:
Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure
To win the King as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers.
PHILARIO:
What means do you make to him?
POSTHUMUS:
Not any; but abide the change of time,
Quake in the present winter's state, and wish
That warmer days would come. In these fear'd hopes
I barely gratify your love; they failing,
I must die much your debtor.
PHILARIO:
Your very goodness and your company
O'erpays all I can do. By this your king
Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
Will do's commission throughly; and I think
He'll grant the tribute, send th' arrearages,
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief.
POSTHUMUS:
I do believe
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage
Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
Now mingled with their courages, will make known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world.
PHILARIO:
See! Iachimo!
POSTHUMUS:
The swiftest harts have posted you by land,
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
To make your vessel nimble.
PHILARIO:
Welcome, sir.
POSTHUMUS:
I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return.
IACHIMO:
Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
POSTHUMUS:
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts,
And be false with them.
IACHIMO:
Here are letters for you.
POSTHUMUS:
Their tenour good, I trust.
IACHIMO:
'Tis very like.
PHILARIO:
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?
IACHIMO:
He was expected then,
But not approach'd.
POSTHUMUS:
All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is't not
Too dull for your good wearing?
IACHIMO:
If I have lost it,
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
I'll make a journey twice as far t' enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.
POSTHUMUS:
The stone's too hard to come by.
IACHIMO:
Not a whit,
Your lady being so easy.
POSTHUMUS:
Make not, sir,
Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends.
IACHIMO:
Good sir, we must,
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
We were to question farther; but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour,
Together with your ring; and not the wronger
Of her or you, having proceeded but
By both your wills.
POSTHUMUS:
If you can make't apparent
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them.
IACHIMO:
Sir, my circumstances,
Being so near the truth as I will make them,
Must first induce you to believe- whose strength
I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not
You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
You need it not.
POSTHUMUS:
Proceed.
IACHIMO:
First, her bedchamber,
Where I confess I slept not, but profess
Had that was well worth watching-it was hang'd
With tapestry of silk and silver; the story,
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
The press of boats or pride. A piece of work
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
Since the true life on't was-
POSTHUMUS:
This is true;
And this you might have heard of here, by me
Or by some other.
IACHIMO:
More particulars
Must justify my knowledge.
POSTHUMUS:
So they must,
Or do your honour injury.
IACHIMO:
The chimney
Is south the chamber, and the chimneypiece
Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves. The cutter
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
Motion and breath left out.
POSTHUMUS:
This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap,
Being, as it is, much spoke of.
IACHIMO:
The roof o' th' chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons-
I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
Depending on their brands.
POSTHUMUS:
This is her honour!
Let it be granted you have seen all this, and praise
Be given to your remembrance; the description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid.
IACHIMO:
Then, if you can,
Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!
And now 'tis up again. It must be married
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
POSTHUMUS:
Jove!
Once more let me behold it. Is it that
Which I left with her?
IACHIMO:
Sir- I thank her- that.
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
She priz'd it once.
POSTHUMUS:
May be she pluck'd it of
To send it me.
IACHIMO:
She writes so to you, doth she?
POSTHUMUS:
O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love
Where there's another man. The vows of women
Of no more bondage be to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
O, above measure false!
PHILARIO:
Have patience, sir,
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
It may be probable she lost it, or
Who knows if one her women, being corrupted
Hath stol'n it from her?
POSTHUMUS:
Very true;
And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.
Render to me some corporal sign about her,
More evident than this; for this was stol'n.
IACHIMO:
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!
POSTHUMUS:
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
She would not lose it. Her attendants are
All sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it!
And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!
PHILARIO:
Sir, be patient;
This is not strong enough to be believ'd
Of one persuaded well of.
POSTHUMUS:
Never talk on't;
She hath been colted by him.
IACHIMO:
If you seek
For further satisfying, under her breast-
Worthy the pressing- lies a mole, right proud
Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
To feed again, though full. You do remember
This stain upon her?
POSTHUMUS:
Ay, and it doth confirm
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it.
IACHIMO:
Will you hear more?
POSTHUMUS:
Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns.
Once, and a million!
IACHIMO:
I'll be sworn-
POSTHUMUS:
No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
Thou'st made me cuckold.
IACHIMO:
I'll deny nothing.
POSTHUMUS:
O that I had her here to tear her limb-meal!
I will go there and do't, i' th' court, before
Her father. I'll do something-
PHILARIO:
Quite besides
The government of patience! You have won.
Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself.
IACHIMO:
With all my heart.
POSTHUMUS:
Is there no way for men to be, but women
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father was I know not where
When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd
The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was't not?
Or less!- at first? Perchance he spoke not, but,
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
But what he look'd for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
That tends to vice in man but I affirm
It is the woman's part. Be it lying, note it,
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather all;
For even to vice
They are not constant, but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill
In a true hate to pray they have their will:
The very devils cannot plague them better.
CYMBELINE:
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
LUCIUS:
When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet
Lives in men's eyes, and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain,
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less
Than in his feats deserving it, for him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
Is left untender'd.
QUEEN:
And, to kill the marvel,
Shall be so ever.
CLOTEN:
There be many Caesars
Ere such another Julius. Britain is
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
For wearing our own noses.
QUEEN:
That opportunity,
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
The kings your ancestors, together with
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
As Neptune's park, ribb'd and pal'd in
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats
But suck them up to th' top-mast. A kind of conquest
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
Of 'came, and saw, and overcame.' With shame-
The first that ever touch'd him- he was carried
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping-
Poor ignorant baubles!- on our terrible seas,
Like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges, crack'd
As easily 'gainst our rocks; for joy whereof
The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point-
O, giglot fortune!- to master Caesar's sword,
Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright
And Britons strut with courage.
CLOTEN:
Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is
stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no
moe such Caesars. Other of them may have crook'd noses; but to
owe such straight arms, none.
CYMBELINE:
Son, let your mother end.
CLOTEN:
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan.
I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should
we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,
or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light;
else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
CYMBELINE:
You must know,
Till the injurious Romans did extort
This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar's ambition-
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
The sides o' th' world- against all colour here
Did put the yoke upon's; which to shake of
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
Ourselves to be.
CLOTEN:
We do.
CYMBELINE:
Say then to Caesar,
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
Who was the first of Britain which did put
His brows within a golden crown, and call'd
Himself a king.
LUCIUS:
I am sorry, Cymbeline,
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar-
Caesar, that hath moe kings his servants than
Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy.
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee; look
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
I thank thee for myself.
CYMBELINE:
Thou art welcome, Caius.
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
Much under him; of him I gather'd honour,
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold;
So Caesar shall not find them.
LUCIUS:
Let proof speak.
CLOTEN:
His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or
two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it,
it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare
the better for you; and there's an end.
LUCIUS:
So, sir.
CYMBELINE:
I know your master's pleasure, and he mine;
All the remain is, welcome.
PISANIO:
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!
O master, what a strange infection
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian-
As poisonous-tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
As would take in some virtue. O my master!
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her?
Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I
Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?
If it be so to do good service, never
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
So much as this fact comes to? 'Do't. The letter
That I have sent her, by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper,
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
Art thou a fedary for this act, and look'st
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
IMOGEN:
How now, Pisanio!
PISANIO:
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
IMOGEN:
Who? thy lord? That is my lord- Leonatus?
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters-
He'd lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
Of my lord's health, of his content; yet not
That we two are asunder- let that grieve him!
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love- of his content,
All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
'Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his
dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of
creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I
am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of
this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness that
remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love
O for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio-
Who long'st like me to see thy lord, who long'st-
O, let me 'bate!- but not like me, yet long'st,
But in a fainter kind- O, not like me,
For mine's beyond beyond!-say, and speak thick-
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
To th' smothering of the sense- how far it is
To this same blessed Milford. And by th' way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
T' inherit such a haven. But first of all,
How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
That we shall make in time from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
How many score of miles may we well ride
'Twixt hour and hour?
PISANIO:
One score 'twixt sun and sun,
Madam, 's enough for you, and too much too.
IMOGEN:
Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i' th' clock's behalf. But this is fool'ry.
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She'll home to her father; and provide me presently
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
PISANIO:
Madam, you're best consider.
IMOGEN:
I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
Do as I bid thee. There's no more to say;
Accessible is none but Milford way.
BELARIUS:
A goodly day not to keep house with such
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how t' adore the heavens, and bows you
To a morning's holy office. The gates of monarchs
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i' th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.
GUIDERIUS:
Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS:
Hail, heaven!
BELARIUS:
Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill,
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off;
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
This service is not service so being done,
But being so allow'd. To apprehend thus
Draws us a profit from all things we see,
And often to our comfort shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a check,
Richer than doing nothing for a bribe,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,
Yet keeps his book uncross'd. No life to ours!
GUIDERIUS:
Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg'd,
Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest, nor know not
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age. But unto us it is
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit.
ARVIRAGUS:
What should we speak of
When we are old as you? When we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse.
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat.
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
We make a choir, as doth the prison'd bird,
And sing our bondage freely.
BELARIUS:
How you speak!
Did you but know the city's usuries,
And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,
As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb
Is certain falling, or so slipp'ry that
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' th' war,
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
I' th'name of fame and honour, which dies i' th'search,
And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
As record of fair act; nay, many times,
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse-
Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story
The world may read in me; my body's mark'd
With Roman swords, and my report was once
first with the best of note. Cymbeline lov'd me;
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
And left me bare to weather.
GUIDERIUS:
Uncertain favour!
BELARIUS:
My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft-
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans. So
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains!
This is not hunters' language. He that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast;
To him the other two shall minister;
And we will fear no poison, which attends
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to th' King,
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly
I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
The King his father call'd Guiderius- Jove!
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Into my story; say 'Thus mine enemy fell,
And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more
His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd!
O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon,
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
Thinking to bar thee of succession as
Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
And every day do honour to her grave.
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
They take for natural father. The game is up.
IMOGEN:
Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd my mother so
To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man!
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
From th' inward of thee? One but painted thus
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
Why tender'st thou that paper to me with
A look untender! If't be summer news,
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
But keep that count'nance still. My husband's hand?
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
May take off some extremity, which to read
Would be even mortal to me.
PISANIO:
Please you read,
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
The most disdain'd of fortune.
IMOGEN:
[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in
my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not
out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as
certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act
for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let
thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity
at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if
thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art
the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.'
PISANIO:
What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper
Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
IMOGEN:
False to his bed? What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there, and to think on him?
To weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,
To break it with a fearful dream of him,
And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,
Is it?
PISANIO:
Alas, good lady!
IMOGEN:
I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now, methinks,
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy,
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him.
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls
I must be ripp'd. To pieces with me! O,
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villainy; not born where't grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.
PISANIO:
Good madam, hear me.
IMOGEN:
True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon's weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men:
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;
Do thou thy master's bidding; when thou seest him,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
Thy master is not there, who was indeed
The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike.
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
But now thou seem'st a coward.
PISANIO:
Hence, vile instrument!
Thou shalt not damn my hand.
IMOGEN:
Why, I must die;
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart-
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence!-
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,
That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King
My father, and make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
It is no act of common passage but
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee dispatch.
The lamp entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife?
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
When I desire it too.
PISANIO:
O gracious lady,
Since I receiv'd command to do this busines
I have not slept one wink.
IMOGEN:
Do't, and to bed then.
PISANIO:
I'll wake mine eyeballs first.
IMOGEN:
Wherefore then
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus'd
So many miles with a pretence? This place?
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
For my being absent?- whereunto I never
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
Th' elected deer before thee?
PISANIO:
But to win time
To lose so bad employment, in the which
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
Hear me with patience.
IMOGEN:
Talk thy tongue weary- speak.
I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
PISANIO:
Then, madam,
I thought you would not back again.
IMOGEN:
Most like-
Bringing me here to kill me.
PISANIO:
Not so, neither;
But if I were as wise as honest, then
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
But that my master is abus'd. Some villain,
Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both
This cursed injury.
IMOGEN:
Some Roman courtezan!
PISANIO:
No, on my life!
I'll give but notice you are dead, and send him
Some bloody sign of it, for 'tis commanded
I should do so. You shall be miss'd at court,
And that will well confirm it.
IMOGEN:
Why, good fellow,
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?
Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dead to my husband?
PISANIO:
If you'll back to th' court-
IMOGEN:
No court, no father, nor no more ado
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing-
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege.
PISANIO:
If not at court,
Then not in Britain must you bide.
IMOGEN:
Where then?
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in't;
In a great pool a swan's nest. Prithee think
There's livers out of Britain.
PISANIO:
I am most glad
You think of other place. Th' ambassador,
To-morrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
That which t' appear itself must not yet be
But by self-danger, you should tread a course
Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,
That though his actions were not visible, yet
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves.
IMOGEN:
O! for such means,
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
I would adventure.
PISANIO:
Well then, here's the point:
You must forget to be a woman; change
Command into obedience; fear and niceness-
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
Woman it pretty self- into a waggish courage;
Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy, and
As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
Exposing it- but, O, the harder heart!
Alack, no remedy!- to the greedy touch
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
You made great Juno angry.
IMOGEN:
Nay, be brief;
I see into thy end, and am almost
A man already.
PISANIO:
First, make yourself but like one.
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit-
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
That answer to them. Would you, in their serving,
And with what imitation you can borrow
From youth of such a season, fore noble Lucius
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
Wherein you're happy- which will make him know
If that his head have ear in music; doubtless
With joy he will embrace you; for he's honourable,
And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad-
You have me, rich; and I will never fail
Beginning nor supplyment.
IMOGEN:
Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with. Prithee away!
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
All that good time will give us. This attempt
I am soldier to, and will abide it with
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
PISANIO:
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
Here is a box; I had it from the Queen.
What's in't is precious. If you are sick at sea
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
Direct you to the best!
IMOGEN:
Amen. I thank thee.
CYMBELINE:
Thus far; and so farewell.
LUCIUS:
Thanks, royal sir.
My emperor hath wrote; I must from hence,
And am right sorry that I must report ye
My master's enemy.
CYMBELINE:
Our subjects, sir,
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
Appear unkinglike.
LUCIUS:
So, sir. I desire of you
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
Madam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!
CYMBELINE:
My lords, you are appointed for that office;
The due of honour in no point omit.
So farewell, noble Lucius.
LUCIUS:
Your hand, my lord.
CLOTEN:
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
I wear it as your enemy.
LUCIUS:
Sir, the event
Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.
CYMBELINE:
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
QUEEN:
He goes hence frowning; but it honours us
That we have given him cause.
CLOTEN:
'Tis all the better;
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
CYMBELINE:
Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness.
The pow'rs that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
His war for Britain.
QUEEN:
'Tis not sleepy business,
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
CYMBELINE:
Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
The duty of the day. She looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
We have noted it. Call her before us, for
We have been too slight in sufferance.
QUEEN:
Royal sir,
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
Forbear sharp speeches to her; she's a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes,
And strokes death to her.
CYMBELINE:
Where is she, sir? How
Can her contempt be answer'd?
MESSENGER:
Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all lock'd, and there's no answer
That will be given to th' loud of noise we make.
QUEEN:
My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close;
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer. This
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.
CYMBELINE:
Her doors lock'd?
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
Prove false!
QUEEN:
Son, I say, follow the King.
CLOTEN:
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
I have not seen these two days.
QUEEN:
Go, look after.
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz'd her;
Or, wing'd with fervour of her love, she's flown
To her desir'd Posthumus. Gone she is
To death or to dishonour, and my end
Can make good use of either. She being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.
How now, my son?
CLOTEN:
'Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none
Dare come about him.
QUEEN:
All the better. May
This night forestall him of the coming day!
CLOTEN:
I love and hate her; for she's fair and royal,
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
That what's else rare is chok'd; and in that point
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
To be reveng'd upon her. For when fools
Shall-
Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain,
Where is thy lady? In a word, or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends.
PISANIO:
O good my lord!
CLOTEN:
Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter-
I will not ask again. Close villain,
I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn.
PISANIO:
Alas, my lord,
How can she be with him? When was she miss'd?
He is in Rome.
CLOTEN:
Where is she, sir? Come nearer.
No farther halting! Satisfy me home
What is become of her.
PISANIO:
O my all-worthy lord!
CLOTEN:
All-worthy villain!
Discover where thy mistress is at once,
At the next word. No more of 'worthy lord'!
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death.
PISANIO:
Then, sir,
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight.
CLOTEN:
Let's see't. I will pursue her
Even to Augustus' throne.
PISANIO:
[Aside] Or this or perish.
She's far enough; and what he learns by this
May prove his travel, not her danger.
CLOTEN:
Humh!
PISANIO:
[Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
CLOTEN:
Sirrah, is this letter true?
PISANIO:
Sir, as I think.
CLOTEN:
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst
not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those
employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a
serious industry- that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do, to
perform it directly and truly- I would think thee an honest man;
thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice
for thy preferment.
PISANIO:
Well, my good lord.
CLOTEN:
Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou
hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou
canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower
of mine. Wilt thou serve me?
PISANIO:
Sir, I will.
CLOTEN:
Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy late
master's garments in thy possession?
PISANIO:
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when
he took leave of my lady and mistress.
CLOTEN:
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let
it be thy first service; go.
PISANIO:
I shall, my lord.
CLOTEN:
Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing;
I'll remember't anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I
kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a
time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble
and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities.
With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him,
and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of
insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined-
which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that
she so prais'd- to the court I'll knock her back, foot her home
again. She hath despis'd me rejoicingly, and I'll be merry in my
revenge.
Be those the garments?
PISANIO:
Ay, my noble lord.
CLOTEN:
How long is't since she went to Milford Haven?
PISANIO:
She can scarce be there yet.
CLOTEN:
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing
that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a
voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment
shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would
I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
PISANIO:
Thou bid'st me to my loss; for true to thee
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
To him that is most true. To Milford go,
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
Be cross'd with slowness! Labour be his meed!
IMOGEN:
I see a man's life is a tedious one.
I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to't; 'tis some savage hold.
I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine,
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
If anything that's civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
But fear the sword, like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
Such a foe, good heavens!
BELARIUS:
You, Polydore, have prov'd best woodman and
Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match.
The sweat of industry would dry and die
But for the end
BER:
Who's there.?
FRAN:
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
BER:
Long live the King!
FRAN:
Bernardo?
BER:
He.
FRAN:
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BER:
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRAN:
For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BER:
Have you had quiet guard?
FRAN:
Not a mouse stirring.
BER:
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRAN:
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
HOR:
Friends to this ground.
MAR:
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRAN:
Give you good night.
MAR:
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Who hath reliev'd you?
FRAN:
Bernardo hath my place.
Give you good night.
MAR:
Holla, Bernardo!
BER:
Say-
What, is Horatio there ?
HOR:
A piece of him.
BER:
Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
MAR:
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BER:
I have seen nothing.
MAR:
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along,
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
That, if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HOR:
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BER:
Sit down awhile,
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we two nights have seen.
HOR:
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BER:
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one-
MAR:
Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
BER:
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
MAR:
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BER:
Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
HOR:
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
BER:
It would be spoke to.
MAR:
Question it, Horatio.
HOR:
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
MAR:
It is offended.
BER:
See, it stalks away!
HOR:
Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
MAR:
'Tis gone and will not answer.
BER:
How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HOR:
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MAR:
Is it not like the King?
HOR:
As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armour he had on
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MAR:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HOR:
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MAR:
Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
Who is't that can inform me?
HOR:
That can I.
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
As it doth well appear unto our state,
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BER:
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
That was and is the question of these wars.
HOR:
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climature and countrymen.
But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me.
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
Speak to me.
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
MAR:
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HOR:
Do, if it will not stand.
BER:
'Tis here!
HOR:
'Tis here!
MAR:
'Tis gone!
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BER:
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HOR:
And then it started, like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine; and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MAR:
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HOR:
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
KING:
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
His further gait herein, in that the levies,
The lists, and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the King, more than the scope
Of these dilated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
COR:
, Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
KING:
We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAER:
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING:
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
POL:
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
KING:
Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
HAM:
[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
KING:
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAM:
Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
QUEEN:
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
HAM:
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN:
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAM:
Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play;
But I have that within which passeth show-
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING:
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father;
But you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
For what we know must be, and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd, whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father; for let the world take note
You are the most immediate to our throne,
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire;
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN:
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
HAM:
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING:
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
HAM:
O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
So excellent a king, that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she followed my poor father's body
Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
HOR:
Hail to your lordship!
HAM:
I am glad to see you well.
Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
HOR:
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAM:
Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Marcellus?
MAR:
My good lord!
HAM:
I am very glad to see you.- Good even, sir.-
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HOR:
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAM:
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HOR:
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAM:
I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HOR:
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
HAM:
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father- methinks I see my father.
HOR:
O, where, my lord?
HAM:
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HOR:
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
HAM:
He was a man, take him for all in all.
I shall not look upon his like again.
HOR:
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAM:
Saw? who?
HOR:
My lord, the King your father.
HAM:
The King my father?
HOR:
Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
HAM:
For God's love let me hear!
HOR:
Two nights together had these gentlemen
In the dead vast and middle of the night
Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes. I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.
HAM:
But where was this?
MAR:
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAM:
Did you not speak to it?
HOR:
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none. Yet once methought
It lifted up it head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanish'd from our sight.
HAM:
'Tis very strange.
HOR:
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAM:
Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
HAM:
Arm'd, say you?
BOTH:
Arm'd, my lord.
HAM:
From top to toe?
BOTH:
My lord, from head to foot.
HAM:
Then saw you not his face?
HOR:
O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
HAM:
What, look'd he frowningly.
HOR:
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAM:
Pale or red?
HOR:
Nay, very pale.
HAM:
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HOR:
Most constantly.
HAM:
I would I had been there.
HOR:
It would have much amaz'd you.
HAM:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HOR:
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
BOTH:
Longer, longer.
HOR:
Not when I saw't.
HAM:
His beard was grizzled- no?
HOR:
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAM:
I will watch to-night.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HOR:
I warr'nt it will.
HAM:
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding but no tongue.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
ALL:
Our duty to your honour.
HAM:
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
LAER:
My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPH:
Do you doubt that?
LAER:
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
No more.
OPH:
No more but so?
LAER:
Think it no more.
For nature crescent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state,
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmast'red importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPH:
I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
And recks not his own rede.
LAER:
O, fear me not!
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
POL:
Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are most select and generous, chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all- to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
LAER:
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
POL:
The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
LAER:
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
What I have said to you.
OPH:
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAER:
Farewell.
POL:
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
OPH:
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
POL:
Marry, well bethought!
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you, and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution- I must tell you
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? Give me up the truth.
OPH:
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
POL:
Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPH:
I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
POL:
Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
OPH:
My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
In honourable fashion.
POL:
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
OPH:
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
POL:
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
OPH:
I shall obey, my lord.
HAM:
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HOR:
It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAM:
What hour now?
HOR:
I think it lacks of twelve.
MAR:
No, it is struck.
HOR:
Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What does this mean, my lord?
HAM:
The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
HOR:
Is it a custom?
HAM:
Ay, marry, is't;
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So oft it chances in particular men
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo-
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
HOR:
Look, my lord, it comes!
HAM:
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again. What may this mean
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
HOR:
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
MAR:
Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground.
But do not go with it!
HOR:
No, by no means!
HAM:
It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
HOR:
Do not, my lord!
HAM:
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
HOR:
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other, horrible form
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
HAM:
It waves me still.
Go on. I'll follow thee.
MAR:
You shall not go, my lord.
HAM:
Hold off your hands!
HOR:
Be rul'd. You shall not go.
HAM:
My fate cries out
And makes each petty artire in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
HOR:
He waxes desperate with imagination.
MAR:
Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
HOR:
Have after. To what issue wail this come?
MAR:
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HOR:
Heaven will direct it.
MAR:
Nay, let's follow him.
HAM:
Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
GHOST:
Mark me.
HAM:
I will.
GHOST:
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
HAM:
Alas, poor ghost!
GHOST:
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
HAM:
Speak. I am bound to hear.
GHOST:
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAM:
What?
GHOST:
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand an end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
HAM:
O God!
GHOST:
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
HAM:
Murther?
GHOST:
Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
HAM:
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
GHOST:
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
HAM:
O my prophetic soul!
My uncle?
GHOST:
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage.
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head.
HAM:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
GHOST:
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.
HAM:
O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables! Meet it is I set it down
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
I have sworn't.
HOR:
(within) My lord, my lord!
MAR:
Lord Hamlet!
HOR:
Heaven secure him!
HAM:
So be it!
MAR:
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
HAM:
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
MAR:
How is't, my noble lord?
HOR:
What news, my lord?
MAR:
O, wonderful!
HOR:
Good my lord, tell it.
HAM:
No, you will reveal it.
HOR:
Not I, my lord, by heaven!
MAR:
Nor I, my lord.
HAM:
How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
BOTH:
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAM:
There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
HOR:
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
HAM:
Why, right! You are in the right!
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
You, as your business and desires shall point you,
For every man hath business and desire,
Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
HOR:
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAM:
I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, faith, heartily.
HOR:
There's no offence, my lord.
HAM:
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
HOR:
What is't, my lord? We will.
HAM:
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
BOTH:
My lord, we will not.
HAM:
Nay, but swear't.
HOR:
In faith,
My lord, not I.
MAR:
Nor I, my lord- in faith.
HAM:
Upon my sword.
MAR:
We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAM:
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
GHOST:
Swear.
HAM:
Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Consent to swear.
HOR:
Propose the oath, my lord.
HAM:
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.
GHOST:
[beneath] Swear.
HAM:
Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
Never to speak of this that you have heard:
Swear by my sword.
GHOST:
[beneath] Swear by his sword.
HAM:
Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
HOR:
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HAM:
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
But come!
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
To put an antic disposition on),
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
Swear.
GHOST:
[beneath] Swear.
HAM:
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you;
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do t' express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
POL:
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
REY:
I will, my lord.
POL:
You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before You visit him, to make inquire
Of his behaviour.
REY:
My lord, I did intend it.
POL:
Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
REY:
Ay, very well, my lord.
POL:
'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
REY:
As gaming, my lord.
POL:
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing. You may go so far.
REY:
My lord, that would dishonour him.
POL:
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency.
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.
REY:
But, my good lord-
POL:
Wherefore should you do this?
REY:
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.
POL:
Marry, sir, here's my drift,
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
You laying these slight sullies on my son
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
He closes with you in this consequence:
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country-
REY:
Very good, my lord.
POL:
And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
REY:
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
gentleman.'
POL:
At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now-
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out.
So, by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
REY:
My lord, I have.
POL:
God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
REY:
Good my lord!
POL:
Observe his inclination in yourself.
REY:
I shall, my lord.
POL:
And let him ply his music.
REY:
Well, my lord.
POL:
Farewell!
How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
OPH:
O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
POL:
With what, i' th' name of God I
OPH:
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
POL:
Mad for thy love?
OPH:
My lord, I do not know,
But truly I do fear it.
POL:
What said he?
OPH:
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
For out o' doors he went without their help
And to the last bended their light on me.
POL:
Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
OPH:
No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me.
POL:
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Come.
KING:
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from th' understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time; so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
QUEEN:
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
ROS:
Both your Majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
GUIL:
But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.
KING:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
QUEEN:
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GUIL:
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him!
QUEEN:
Ay, amen!
POL:
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully return'd.
KING:
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
POL:
Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king;
And I do think- or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
KING:
O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
POL:
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
KING:
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
QUEEN:
I doubt it is no other but the main,
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
KING:
Well, we shall sift him.
Welcome, my good friends.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
VOLT:
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
But better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack;
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.
KING:
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
Most welcome home!
POL:
This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
QUEEN:
More matter, with less art.
POL:
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect-
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
But you shall hear. Thus:
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
QUEEN:
Came this from Hamlet to her?
POL:
Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.
reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
it. Adieu.
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
All given to mine ear.
KING:
But how hath she
Receiv'd his love?
POL:
What do you think of me?
KING:
As of a man faithful and honourable.
POL:
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
Before my daughter told me), what might you,
Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
What might you think? No, I went round to work
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
KING:
Do you think 'tis this?
QUEEN:
it may be, very like.
POL:
Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
When it prov'd otherwise.?
KING:
Not that I know.
POL:
[points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.
KING:
How may we try it further?
POL:
You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.
QUEEN:
So he does indeed.
POL:
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.
KING:
We will try it.
QUEEN:
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
POL:
Away, I do beseech you, both away
I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAM:
Well, God-a-mercy.
POL:
Do you know me, my lord?
HAM:
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
POL:
Not I, my lord.
HAM:
Then I would you were so honest a man.
POL:
Honest, my lord?
HAM:
Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
pick'd out of ten thousand.
POL:
That's very true, my lord.
HAM:
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
POL:
I have, my lord.
HAM:
Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
POL:
[aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
read, my lord?
HAM:
Words, words, words.
POL:
What is the matter, my lord?
HAM:
Between who?
POL:
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAM:
Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.
POL:
[aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
HAM:
Into my grave?
POL:
Indeed, that is out o' th' air. How pregnant sometimes
his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
my leave of you.
HAM:
You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
life,
POL:
Fare you well, my lord.
HAM:
These tedious old fools!
POL:
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
ROS:
[to Polonius] God save you, sir!
GUIL:
My honour'd lord!
ROS:
My most dear lord!
HAM:
My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
ROS:
As the indifferent children of the earth.
GUIL:
Happy in that we are not over-happy.
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
HAM:
Nor the soles of her shoe?
ROS:
Neither, my lord.
HAM:
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
favours?
GUIL:
Faith, her privates we.
HAM:
In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
strumpet. What news ?
ROS:
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
HAM:
Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
hither?
GUIL:
Prison, my lord?
HAM:
Denmark's a prison.
ROS:
Then is the world one.
HAM:
A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
ROS:
We think not so, my lord.
HAM:
Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
ROS:
Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
mind.
HAM:
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
GUIL:
Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
HAM:
A dream itself is but a shadow.
ROS:
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadow's shadow.
HAM:
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
fay, I cannot reason.
BOTH:
We'll wait upon you.
HAM:
No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
make you at Elsinore?
ROS:
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
HAM:
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
GUIL:
What should we say, my lord?
HAM:
Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you.
ROS:
To what end, my lord?
HAM:
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
me, whether you were sent for or no.
ROS:
[aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
HAM:
[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
not off.
GUIL:
My lord, we were sent for.
HAM:
I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
ROS:
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
HAM:
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
ROS:
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
HAM:
He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
they?
ROS:
Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
tragedians of the city.
HAM:
How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.
ROS:
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.
HAM:
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city? Are they so follow'd?
ROS:
No indeed are they not.
HAM:
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
ROS:
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
dare scarce come thither.
HAM:
What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession.
ROS:
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.
HAM:
Is't possible?
GUIL:
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
HAM:
Do the boys carry it away?
ROS:
Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
HAM:
It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
philosophy could find it out.
GUIL:
There are the players.
HAM:
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
GUIL:
In what, my dear lord?
HAM:
I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
know a hawk from a handsaw.
POL:
Well be with you, gentlemen!
HAM:
Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
clouts.
ROS:
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
man is twice a child.
HAM:
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
POL:
My lord, I have news to tell you.
HAM:
My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
Rome-
POL:
The actors are come hither, my lord.
HAM:
Buzz, buzz!
POL:
Upon my honour-
HAM:
Then came each actor on his ass-
POL:
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene
individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
the only men.
HAM:
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
POL:
What treasure had he, my lord?
HAM:
Why,
POL:
[aside] Still on my daughter.
HAM:
Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
POL:
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
love passing well.
HAM:
Nay, that follows not.
POL:
What follows then, my lord?
HAM:
Why,
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
where my abridgment comes.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of
uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
HAM:
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd
not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
So, proceed you.
POL:
Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
POL:
This is too long.
HAM:
It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
Hecuba.
HAM:
'The mobled queen'?
POL:
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
POL:
Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
eyes. Prithee no more!
HAM:
'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
POL:
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
HAM:
God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
your bounty. Take them in.
POL:
Come, sirs.
HAM:
Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
Gonzago'?
HAM:
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
insert in't, could you not?
HAM:
Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
Elsinore.
ROS:
Good my lord!
HAM:
Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
Now I am alone.
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
Play something like the murther of my father
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be a devil; and the devil hath power
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
More relative than this. The play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.
KING:
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
ROS:
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
GUIL:
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
QUEEN:
Did he receive you well?
ROS:
Most like a gentleman.
GUIL:
But with much forcing of his disposition.
ROS:
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.
QUEEN:
Did you assay him
To any pastime?
ROS:
Madam, it so fell out that certain players
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are here about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
POL:
'Tis most true;
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
To hear and see the matter.
KING:
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin'd.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
ROS:
We shall, my lord.
KING:
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia.
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
That thus he suffers for.
QUEEN:
I shall obey you;
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.
OPH:
Madam, I wish it may.
POL:
Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.- Read on this book,
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The Devil himself.
KING:
[aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burthen!
POL:
I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
HAM:
To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death-
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememb'red.
OPH:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAM:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPH:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
HAM:
No, not I!
I never gave you aught.
OPH:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
HAM:
Ha, ha! Are you honest?
OPH:
My lord?
HAM:
Are you fair?
OPH:
What means your lordship?
HAM:
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.
OPH:
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
HAM:
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
OPH:
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
HAM:
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
not.
OPH:
I was the more deceived.
HAM:
Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
father?
OPH:
At home, my lord.
HAM:
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
OPH:
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
HAM:
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
OPH:
O heavenly powers, restore him!
HAM:
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your
wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
they are. To a nunnery, go.
OPH:
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
KING:
Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected tribute.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
With variable objects, shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
POL:
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
But if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him; or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.
KING:
It shall be so.
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
HAM:
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
PLAYER:
I warrant your honour.
HAM:
Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
humanity so abominably.
PLAYER:
I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
HAM:
O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
make you ready.
How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
POL:
And the Queen too, and that presently.
HAM:
Bid the players make haste, Will you two
help to hasten them?
BOTH:
We will, my lord.
HAM:
What, ho, Horatio!
HOR:
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HAM:
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
HOR:
O, my dear lord!
HAM:
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee,
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee. Something too much of this I
There is a play to-night before the King.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
HOR:
Well, my lord.
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
HAM:
They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
Get you a place.
KING:
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
HAM:
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
KING:
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
mine.
HAM:
No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once
i' th' university, you say?
POL:
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
HAM:
What did you enact?
POL:
I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
kill'd me.
HAM:
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
the players ready.
ROS:
Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
QUEEN:
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
HAM:
No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
POL:
[to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
HAM:
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
OPH:
No, my lord.
HAM:
I mean, my head upon your lap?
OPH:
Ay, my lord.
HAM:
Do you think I meant country matters?
OPH:
I think nothing, my lord.
HAM:
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
OPH:
What is, my lord?
HAM:
Nothing.
OPH:
You are merry, my lord.
HAM:
Who, I?
OPH:
Ay, my lord.
HAM:
O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
within 's two hours.
OPH:
Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
HAM:
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end
KING:
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood.
No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Nor Bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery,
Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks
March all one way and be no more oppos'd
Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ-
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engag'd to fight-
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our Council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.
WEST:
My liege, this haste was hot in question
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight; when all athwart there came
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butchered;
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
KING:
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
WEST:
This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the North, and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
At Holmedon met,
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;
As by discharge of their artillery
And shape of likelihood the news was told;
For he that brought them, in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse,
Uncertain of the issue any way.
KING:
Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;
Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
And is not this an honourable spoil?
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
WEST:
In faith,
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
KING:
Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son-
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride;
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov'd
That some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd
In cradle clothes our children where they lay,
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners
Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd
To his own use he keeps, and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
WEST:
This is his uncle's teaching, this Worcester,
Malevolent to you In all aspects,
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity.
KING:
But I have sent for him to answer this;
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor. So inform the lords;
But come yourself with speed to us again;
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered.
WEST:
I will my liege.
FAL:
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
PRINCE:
Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and
unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after
noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time
of the day, Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons,
and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping
houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in
flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so
superfluous to demand the time of the day.
FAL:
Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go
by the moon And the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that
wand'ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art
king, as, God save thy Grace-Majesty I should say, for grace thou
wilt have none-
PRINCE:
What, none?
FAL:
No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to
an egg and butter.
PRINCE:
Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
FAL:
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that
are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's
beauty. Let us be Diana's Foresters, Gentlemen of the Shade,
Minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good
government, being governed as the sea is, by our noble and chaste
mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
PRINCE:
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of
us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being
governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof now: a purse
of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by,'
and spent with crying 'Bring in'; now ill as low an ebb as the
foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge
of the gallows.
FAL:
By the Lord, thou say'st true, lad- and is not my hostess of
the tavern a most sweet wench?
PRINCE:
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not
a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
FAL:
How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy
quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?
PRINCE:
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
FAL:
Well, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.
PRINCE:
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
FAL:
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
PRINCE:
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and
where it would not, I have used my credit.
FAL:
Yea, and so us'd it that, were it not here apparent that thou
art heir apparent- But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be
gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution
thus fubb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the
law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
PRINCE:
No; thou shalt.
FAL:
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
PRINCE:
Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
FAL:
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour as
well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.
PRINCE:
For obtaining of suits?
FAL:
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean
wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugg'd
bear.
PRINCE:
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
FAL:
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
PRINCE:
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor
Ditch?
FAL:
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art indeed the most
comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee
trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew
where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of
the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir,
but I mark'd him not; and yet he talked very wisely, but I
regarded him not; and yet he talk'd wisely, and in the street
too.
PRINCE:
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and
no man regards it.
FAL:
O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to
corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal- God
forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and
now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of
the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over!
By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain! I'll be damn'd for
never a king's son in Christendom.
PRINCE:
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
FAL:
Zounds, where thou wilt, lad! I'll make one. An I do not, call
me villain and baffle me.
PRINCE:
I see a good amendment of life in thee- from praying to
purse-taking.
FAL:
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to
labour in his vocation.
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men
were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for
him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand!'
to a true man.
PRINCE:
Good morrow, Ned.
POINS:
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? What
says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee
about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a
cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?
PRINCE:
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his
bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give
the devil his due.
POINS:
Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the devil.
PRINCE:
Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil.
POINS:
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock
early, at Gadshill! There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with
rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I
have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves.
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester. I have bespoke supper
to-morrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If
you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will
not, tarry at home and be hang'd!
FAL:
Hear ye, Yedward: if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you
for going.
POINS:
You will, chops?
FAL:
Hal, wilt thou make one?
PRINCE:
Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.
FAL:
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,
nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand
for ten shillings.
PRINCE:
Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
FAL:
Why, that's well said.
PRINCE:
Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
FAL:
By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
PRINCE:
I care not.
POINS:
Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will
lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.
FAL:
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears
of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears
may be believed, that the true prince may (for recreation sake)
prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance. Farewell; you shall find me in Eastcheap.
PRINCE:
Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
POINS:
Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us to-morrow. I
have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff,
Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have
already waylaid; yourself and I will not be there; and when they
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off
from my shoulders.
PRINCE:
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
POINS:
Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and
then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they
shall have no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
PRINCE:
Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by
our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.
POINS:
Tut! our horses they shall not see- I'll tie them in the
wood; our wizards we will change after we leave them; and,
sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our
noted outward garments.
PRINCE:
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
POINS:
Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred
cowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight
longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of
this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat
rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,
he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he
endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.
PRINCE:
Well, I'll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary
and meet me to-night in Eastcheap. There I'll sup. Farewell.
POINS:
Farewell, my lord.
PRINCE:
I know you all, and will awhile uphold
The unyok'd humour of your idleness.
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world,
That, when he please again to lie himself,
Being wanted, he may be more wond'red at
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays,
To sport would be as tedious as to work;
But when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come,
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
So, when this loose behaviour I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised,
By how much better than my word I am,
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
My reformation, glitt'ring o'er my fault,
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
I'll so offend to make offence a skill,
Redeeming time when men think least I will.
KING:
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
And you have found me, for accordingly
You tread upon my patience; but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
WOR:
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it-
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.
NORTH:
My lord-
KING:
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
Tou have good leave to leave us. When we need
'Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
You were about to speak.
NORTH:
Yea, my good lord.
Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
As is delivered to your Majesty.
Either envy, therefore, or misprision
Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.
HOT:
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
But I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toll,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dress'd,
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
Show'd like a stubble land at harvest home.
He was perfumed like a milliner,
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose, and took't away again;
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
Took it in snuff; and still he smil'd and talk'd;
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
To be so pest'red with a popingay,
Out of my grief and my impatience
Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what-
He should, or he should not; for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
Of guns and drums and wounds- God save the mark!-
And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
Was parmacity for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,
He would himself have been a soldier.
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
I answered indirectly, as I said,
And I beseech you, let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
BLUNT:
The circumstance considered, good my lord,
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
To such a person, and in such a place,
At such a time, with all the rest retold,
May reasonably die, and never rise
To do him wrong, or any way impeach
What then he said, so he unsay it now.
KING:
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
But with proviso and exception,
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
No, on the barren mountains let him starve!
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
HOT:
Revolted Mortimer?
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
But by the chance of war. To prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
In single opposition hand to hand,
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants.
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many, and all willingly.
Then let not him be slandered with revolt.
KING:
Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him!
He never did encounter with Glendower.
I tell thee
He durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
Art thou not asham'd? But, sirrah, henceforth
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
We license your departure with your son.-
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
HOT:
An if the devil come and roar for them,
I will not send them. I will after straight
And tell him so; for I will else my heart,
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
NORTH:
What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile.
Here comes your uncle.
HOT:
Speak of Mortimer?
Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him!
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful king,
As this ingrate and cank'red Bolingbroke.
NORTH:
Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.
WOR:
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
HOT:
He will (forsooth) have all my prisoners;
And when I urg'd the ransom once again
Of my wive's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
WOR:
I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaim'd
By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?
NORTH:
He was; I heard the proclamation.
And then it was when the unhappy King
Upon his Irish expedition;
From whence he intercepted did return
To be depos'd, and shortly murdered.
WOR:
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of.
HOT:
But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown?
NORTH:
He did; myself did hear it.
HOT:
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.
But shall it be that you, that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man,
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murtherous subornation- shall it be
That you a world of curses undergo,
Being the agents or base second means,
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
O, pardon me that I descend so low
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtile king!
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
That you are fool'd, discarded, and shook off
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
No! yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again;
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
Of this proud king, who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.
Therefore I say-
WOR:
Peace, cousin, say no more;
And now, I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
HOT:
If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!
Send danger from the east unto the west,
So honour cross it from the north to south,
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
NORTH:
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
HOT:
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon,
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
Where fadom line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities;
But out upon this half-fac'd fellowship!
WOR:
He apprehends a world of figures here,
But not the form of what he should attend.
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
HOT:
I cry you mercy.
WOR:
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners-
HOT:
I'll keep them all.
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them!
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.
I'll keep them, by this hand!
WOR:
You start away.
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
Those prisoners you shall keep.
HOT:
Nay, I will! That is flat!
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,
But I will find him when he lies asleep,
And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer.'
Nay;
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
To keep his anger still in motion.
WOR:
Hear you, cousin, a word.
HOT:
All studies here I solemnly defy
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke;
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance,
I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.
WOR:
Farewell, kinsman. I will talk to you
When you are better temper'd to attend.
NORTH:
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
HOT:
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods,
Nettled, and stung with pismires when I hear
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
In Richard's time- what do you call the place-
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
His uncle York- where I first bow'd my knee
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke-
'S blood!
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh-
NORTH:
At Berkeley Castle.
HOT:
You say true.
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
Look, 'when his infant fortune came to age,'
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin'-
O, the devil take such cozeners!- God forgive me!
Good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.
WOR:
Nay, if you have not, to it again.
We will stay your leisure.
HOT:
I have done, i' faith.
WOR:
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
For powers In Scotland; which, for divers reasons
Which I shall send you written, be assur'd
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
Of that same noble prelate well-belov'd,
The Archbishop.
HOT:
Of York, is it not?
WOR:
True; who bears hard
His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.
I speak not this in estimation,
As what I think might be, but what I know
Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
HOT:
I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.
NORTH:
Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.
HOT:
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer, ha?
WOR:
And so they shall.
HOT:
In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
WOR:
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
To save our heads by raising of a head;
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
The King will always think him in our debt,
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.
HOT:
He does, he does! We'll be reveng'd on him.
WOR:
Cousin, farewell. No further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,
Where you and Douglas, and our pow'rs at once,
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
NORTH:
Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.
HOT:
Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

GADS:
I pray thee lend me thine.
I'll see thee hang'd first!
GADS:
Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the gentlemen. They will
along with company, for they have great charge.
GADS:
What, ho! chamberlain!
CHAM:
At hand, quoth pickpurse.
GADS:
That's even as fair as- 'at hand, quoth the chamberlain'; for
thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction
doth from labouring: thou layest the plot how.
CHAM:
Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told
you yesternight. There's a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath
brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it
to one of his company last night at supper- a kind of auditor;
one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are
up already and call for eggs and butter. They will away
presently.
GADS:
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll
give thee this neck.
CHAM:
No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman;
for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of
falsehood may.
GADS:
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'll make
a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me,
and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut! there are other
Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are
content to do the profession some grace; that would (if matters
should be look'd into) for their own credit sake make all whole.
I am joined with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny
strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued maltworms; but
with nobility, and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers,
such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and
speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray; and yet,
zounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for
they ride up and down on her and make her their boots.
CHAM:
What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water
in foul way?
GADS:
She will, she will! Justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in
a castle, cocksure. We have the receipt of fernseed, we walk
invisible.
CHAM:
Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night
than to fernseed for your walking invisible.
GADS:
Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as
I and a true man.
CHAM:
Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
GADS:
Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler
bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.
POINS:
Come, shelter, shelter! I have remov'd Falstaff's horse, and
he frets like a gumm'd velvet.
PRINCE:
Stand close.
FAL:
Poins! Poins, and be hang'd! Poins!
PRINCE:
I comes forward I Peace, ye fat-kidney'd rascal! What a
brawling dost thou keep!
FAL:
Where's Poins, Hal?
PRINCE:
He is walk'd up to the top of the hill. I'll go seek him.
FAL:
I am accurs'd to rob in that thief's company. The rascal hath
removed my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travel but
four foot by the squire further afoot, I shall break my wind.
Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company
hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitch'd
with the rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hang'd. It could not be
else. I have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both!
Bardolph! Peto! I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An
'twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave
these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a
tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles
afoot with me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well
enough. A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to
another! (They whistle.) Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my
horse, you rogues! give me my horse and be hang'd!
PRINCE:
[comes forward] Peace, ye fat-guts! Lie down, lay thine ear
close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of
travellers.
FAL:
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblood,
I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin
in thy father's exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
PRINCE:
Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
FAL:
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king's
son.
PRINCE:
Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?
FAL:
Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be
ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you
all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison.
When a jest is so forward- and afoot too- I hate it.
GADS:
Stand!
FAL:
So I do, against my will.
POINS:
[comes fortward] O, 'tis our setter. I know his voice.
Bardolph, what news?
BAR:
Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the
King's coming down the hill; 'tis going to the King's exchequer.
FAL:
You lie, ye rogue! 'Tis going to the King's tavern.
GADS:
There's enough to make us all.
FAL:
To be hang'd.
PRINCE:
Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned
Poins and I will walk lower. If they scape from your encounter,
then they light on us.
PETO:
How many be there of them?
GADS:
Some eight or ten.
FAL:
Zounds, will they not rob us?
PRINCE:
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
FAL:
Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no
coward, Hal.
PRINCE:
Well, we leave that to the proof.
POINS:
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge. When thou
need'st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell and stand fast.
FAL:
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang'd.
PRINCE:
[aside to Poins] Ned, where are our disguises?
POINS:
[aside to Prince] Here, hard by. Stand close.
FAL:
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I. Every man to
his business.
TRAVELLER:
Come, neighbour.
The boy shall lead our horses down the hill;
We'll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs.
THIEVES:
Stand!
TRAVELLER:
Jesus bless us!
FAL:
Strike! down with them! cut the villains' throats! Ah,
whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth. Down
with them! fleece them!
TRAVELLER:
O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
FAL:
Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs;
I would your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves!
young men must live. You are grandjurors, are ye? We'll jure ye,
faith!
PRINCE:
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I
rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it would be argument
for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.
POINS:
Stand close! I hear them coming.
FAL:
Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there's no
equity stirring. There's no more valour in that Poins than in a
wild duck.
PRINCE:
Your money!
POINS:
Villains!
PRINCE:
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse.
The thieves are scattered, and possess'd with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other.
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death
And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
Were't not for laughing, I should pity him.
POINS:
How the rogue roar'd!
HOT:
'But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to
be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.' He could be
contented- why is he not then? In respect of the love he bears
our house! He shows in this he loves his own barn better than he
loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The purpose you undertake
is dangerous'- Why, that's certain! 'Tis dangerous to take a
cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of
this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The purpose
you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain,
the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light for the
counterpoise of so great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so?
I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you
lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good
plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good
plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my
Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the
action. Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him
with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and
myself; Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen
Glendower? Is there not, besides, the Douglas? Have I not all
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month,
and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan
rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very
sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the King and lay open
all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to buffets
for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action!
Hang him, let him tell the King! we are prepared. I will set
forward to-night.
How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two hours.
LADY:
O my good lord, why are you thus alone?
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-ey'd musing and curs'd melancholy?
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tent,
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles ill a late-disturbed stream,
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
HOT:
What, ho!
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
SERV:
He is, my lord, an hour ago.
HOT:
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
SERV:
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
HOT:
What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
SERV:
It is, my lord.
HOT:
That roan shall be my throne.
Well, I will back him straight. O esperance!
Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
LADY:
But hear you, my lord.
HOT:
What say'st thou, my lady?
LADY:
What is it carries you away?
HOT:
Why, my horse, my love- my horse!
LADY:
Out, you mad-headed ape!
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
As you are toss'd with. In faith,
I'll know your business, Harry; that I will!
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
About his title and hath sent for you
To line his enterprise; but if you go-
HOT:
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
LADY:
Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
Directly unto this question that I ask.
I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
An if thou wilt not tell my all things true.
HOT:
Away.
Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not;
I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
And pass them current too. Gods me, my horse!
What say'st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have with me?
LADY:
Do you not love me? do you not indeed?
Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
HOT:
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when I am a-horseback, I will swear
I love thee infinitely. But hark you. Kate:
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.
Whither I must, I must; and to conclude,
This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
I know you wise; but yet no farther wise
Than Harry Percy's wife; constant you are,
But yet a woman; and for secrecy,
No lady closer, for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
LADY:
How? so far?
HOT:
Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
Will this content you, Kate,?
LADY:
It must of force.
PRINCE:
Ned, prithee come out of that fat-room and lend me thy hand
to laugh a little.
POINS:
Where hast been, Hal?
Prince,. With three or four loggerheads amongst three or
fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very bass-string of
humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers and
can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and
Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that, though
I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell
me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a
lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and
when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads
Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dying scarlet; and when
you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it
off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an
hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during
my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou
wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned- to sweeten which
name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp'd even
now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other
English in his life than 'Eight shillings and sixpence,' and 'You
are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score
a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,' or so- but, Ned, to drive
away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some
by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end be gave me
the sugar; and do thou never leave calling 'Francis!' that his
tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon!' Step aside, and I'll show
thee a precedent.
POINS:
Francis!
PRINCE:
Thou art perfect.
POINS:
Francis!
FRAN:
Anon, anon, sir.- Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
PRINCE:
Come hither, Francis.
FRAN:
My lord?
PRINCE:
How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
FRAN:
Forsooth, five years, and as much as to-
POINS:
[within] Francis!
FRAN:
Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE:
Five year! by'r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of
Pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the
coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and
run from it?
FRAN:
O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in England I
could find in my heart-
POINS:
[within] Francis!
FRAN:
Anon, sir.
PRINCE:
How old art thou, Francis?
FRAN:
Let me see. About Michaelmas next I shall be-
POINS:
[within] Francis!
FRAN:
Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
PRINCE:
Nay, but hark you, Francis. For the sugar thou gavest me-
'twas a pennyworth, wast not?
FRAN:
O Lord! I would it had been two!
PRINCE:
I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou
wilt, and, thou shalt have it.
POINS:
[within] Francis!
FRAN:
Anon, anon.
PRINCE:
Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,
Francis, a Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But
Francis-
FRAN:
My lord?
PRINCE:
Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button,
not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch-
FRAN:
O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
PRINCE:
Why then, your brown bastard is your only drink; for look
you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary,
sir, it cannot come to so much.
FRAN:
What, sir?
POINS:
[within] Francis!
PRINCE:
Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?
VINT:
What, stand'st thou still, and hear'st such a calling? Look
to the guests within. My lord, old Sir John, with
half-a-dozen more, are at the door. Shall I let them in?
PRINCE:
Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
Poins!
POINS:
[within] Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE:
Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the
door. Shall we be merry?
POINS:
As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning
match have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what's
the issue?
PRINCE:
I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours
since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this
present this twelve o'clock at midnight.
What's o'clock, Francis?
FRAN:
Anon, anon, sir.
PRINCE:
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and
downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet
of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kills me some
six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and
says to his wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my
sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou
'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he, and answers 'Some
fourteen,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee call in
Falstaff. I'll play Percy, and that damn'd brawn shall play Dame
Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call
in tallow.
POINS:
Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?
FAL:
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry and
amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I'll
sew nether-stocks, and mend them and foot them too. A plague of
all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue
extant?
PRINCE:
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
Pitiful-hearted butter, that melted at the sweet tale of the sun!
If thou didst, then behold that compound.
FAL:
You rogue, here's lime in this sack too! There is nothing but
roguery to be found in villanous man. Yet a coward is worse than
a cup of sack with lime in it- a villanous coward! Go thy ways,
old Jack, die when thou wilt; if manhood, good manhood, be not
forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten herring.
There lives not three good men unhang'd in England; and one of
them is fat, and grows old. God help the while! A bad world, I
say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything. A
plague of all cowards I say still!
PRINCE:
How now, woolsack? What mutter you?
FAL:
A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a
dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock
of wild geese, I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince
of Wales?
PRINCE:
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
FAL:
Are not you a coward? Answer me to that- and Poins there?
POINS:
Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
Lord, I'll stab thee.
FAL:
I call thee coward? I'll see thee damn'd ere I call thee
coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as
thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders; you care
not who sees Your back. Call you that backing of your friends? A
plague upon such backing! Give me them that will face me. Give me
a cup of sack. I am a rogue if I drunk to-day.
PRINCE:
O villain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st
last.
FAL:
All is one for that. (He drinketh.) A plague of all cowards
still say I.
PRINCE:
What's the matter?
FAL:
What's the matter? There be four of us here have ta'en a
thousand pound this day morning.
PRINCE:
Where is it, Jack? Where is it?
FAL:
Where is it, Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four of
us!
PRINCE:
What, a hundred, man?
FAL:
I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them
two hours together. I have scap'd by miracle. I am eight times
thrust through the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
through and through; my sword hack'd like a handsaw- ecce signum!
I never dealt better since I was a man. All would not do. A
plague of all cowards! Let them speak, If they speak more or less
than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
PRINCE:
Speak, sirs. How was it?
GADS:
We four set upon some dozen-
FAL:
Sixteen at least, my lord.
GADS:
And bound them.
PETO:
No, no, they were not bound.
FAL:
You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew
else- an Ebrew Jew.
GADS:
As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us-
FAL:
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
PRINCE:
What, fought you with them all?
FAL:
All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with
fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish! If there were not two or
three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legg'd
creature.
PRINCE:
Pray God you have not murd'red some of them.
FAL:
Nay, that's past praying for. I have pepper'd two of them. Two
I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee
what, Hal- if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.
Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point.
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.
PRINCE:
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.
FAL:
Four, Hal. I told thee four.
POINS:
Ay, ay, he said four.
FAL:
These four came all afront and mainly thrust at me. I made me
no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.
PRINCE:
Seven? Why, there were but four even now.
FAL:
In buckram?
POINS:
Ay, four, in buckram suits.
FAL:
Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
PRINCE:
[aside to Poins] Prithee let him alone. We shall have more
anon.
FAL:
Dost thou hear me, Hal?
PRINCE:
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
FAL:
Do so, for it is worth the list'ning to. These nine in buckram
that I told thee of-
PRINCE:
So, two more already.
FAL:
Their points being broken-
POINS:
Down fell their hose.
FAL:
Began to give me ground; but I followed me close, came in,
foot and hand, and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid.
PRINCE:
O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!
FAL:
But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in
Kendal green came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so
dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.
PRINCE:
These lies are like their father that begets them- gross as
a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brain'd guts, thou
knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch-
FAL:
What, art thou mad? art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?
PRINCE:
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green when
it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your
reason. What sayest thou to this?
POINS:
Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
FAL:
What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strappado or
all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion.
Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.
PRINCE:
I'll be no longer guilty, of this sin; this sanguine
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill
of flesh-
FAL:
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
neat's-tongue, you bull's sizzle, you stockfish- O for breath to
utter what is like thee!- you tailor's yard, you sheath, you
bowcase, you vile standing tuck!
PRINCE:
Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou
hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.
POINS:
Mark, Jack.
PRINCE:
We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were
masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shall put you
down. Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfac'd
you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here
in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as
nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roar'd for mercy, and still
run and roar'd, as ever I heard bullcalf. What a slave art thou
to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in
fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole canst thou now
find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?
POINS:
Come, let's hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?
FAL:
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear
you, my masters. Was it for me to kill the heir apparent? Should
I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as
Hercules; but beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true
prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a coward on
instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my
life- I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by
the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to
the doors. Watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys,
hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you!
What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play extempore?
PRINCE:
Content- and the argument shall be thy running away.
FAL:
Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
HOST:
O Jesu, my lord the Prince!
PRINCE:
How now, my lady the hostess? What say'st thou to me?
HOST:
Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door
would speak with you. He says he comes from your father.
PRINCE:
Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him
back again to my mother.
FAL:
What manner of man is he?
HOST:
An old man.
FAL:
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him
his answer?
PRINCE:
Prithee do, Jack.
FAL:
Faith, and I'll send him packing.
PRINCE:
Now, sirs. By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so
did you, Bardolph. You are lions too, you ran away upon instinct,
you will not touch the true prince; no- fie!
BARD:
Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
PRINCE:
Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so
hack'd?
PETO:
Why, he hack'd it with his dagger, and said he would swear
truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in
fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
BARD:
Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it
was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year
before- I blush'd to hear his monstrous devices.
PRINCE:
O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago
and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush'd
extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou
ran'st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?
BARD:
My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these
exhalations?
PRINCE:
I do.
BARD:
What think you they portend?
PRINCE:
Hot livers and cold purses.
BARD:
Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
PRINCE:
No, if rightly taken, halter.
Here comes lean Jack; here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet
creature of bombast? How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest
thine own knee?
FAL:
My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an
eagle's talent in the waist; I could have crept into any
alderman's thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a
man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad. Here was
Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the court in the
morning. That same mad fellow of the North, Percy, and he of
Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold,
and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
hook- what a plague call you him?
POINS:
O, Glendower.
FAL:
Owen, Owen- the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old
Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that
runs a-horseback up a hill perpendicular-
PRINCE:
He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a
sparrow flying.
FAL:
You have hit it.
PRINCE:
So did he never the sparrow.
FAL:
Well, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.
PRINCE:
Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for
running!
FAL:
A-horseback, ye cuckoo! but afoot he will not budge a foot.
PRINCE:
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
FAL:
I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one
Mordake, and a thousand bluecaps more. Worcester is stol'n away
to-night; thy father's beard is turn'd white with the news; you
may buy land now as cheap as stinking mack'rel.
PRINCE:
Why then, it is like, if there come a hot June, and this
civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy
hobnails, by the hundreds.
FAL:
By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shall have
good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible
afeard? Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out
three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit
Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid?
Doth not thy blood thrill at it?
PRINCE:
Not a whit, i' faith. I lack some of thy instinct.
FAL:
Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to
thy father. If thou love me, practise an answer.
PRINCE:
Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the
particulars of my life.
FAL:
Shall I? Content. This chair shall be my state, this dagger my
sceptre, and this cushion my, crown.
PRINCE:
Thy state is taken for a join'd-stool, thy golden sceptre
for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful
bald crown.
FAL:
Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt
thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red,
that it may be thought I have wept; for I must speak in passion,
and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein.
PRINCE:
Well, here is my leg.
FAL:
And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
HOST:
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
FAL:
Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.
HOST:
O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!
FAL:
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen!
For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.
HOST:
O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as
ever I see!
FAL:
Peace, good pintpot. Peace, good tickle-brain.- Harry, I do
not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou
art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden
on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the
sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's
word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of
thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth
warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why,
being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of
heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be
ask'd. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A
question to be ask'd. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast
often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name
of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile;
so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak
to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion;
not in words only, but in woes also: and yet there is a virtuous
man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not
name.
PRINCE:
What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
FAL:
A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful
look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think,
his age some fifty, or, by'r Lady, inclining to threescore; and
now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be
lewdly, given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his
looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit
by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in
that Falstaff. Him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now,
thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou been this month?
PRINCE:
Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll
play my father.
FAL:
Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,
both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a
rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
PRINCE:
Well, here I am set.
FAL:
And here I stand. Judge, my masters.
PRINCE:
Now, Harry, whence come you?
FAL:
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
PRINCE:
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
FAL:
'Sblood, my lord, they are false! Nay, I'll tickle ye for a
young prince, i' faith.
PRINCE:
Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me.
Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil
haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man; a tun of man is
thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours,
that bolting hutch of beastliness, that swoll'n parcel of
dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuff'd cloakbag of
guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,
that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that
vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink
it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it?
wherein cunning, but in craft? wherein crafty, but in villany?
wherein villanous, but in all things? wherein worthy, but in
nothing?
FAL:
I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your
Grace?
PRINCE:
That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,
that old white-bearded Satan.
FAL:
My lord, the man I know.
PRINCE:
I know thou dost.
FAL:
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say
more than I know. That he is old (the more the pity) his white
hairs do witness it; but that he is (saving your reverence) a
whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many
an old host that I know is damn'd. If to be fat be to be hated,
then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord.
Banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but for sweet Jack
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack
Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being, as he is, old Jack
Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company, banish not him thy
Harry's company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world!
PRINCE:
I do, I will.
BARD:
O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most monstrous watch
is at the door.
FAL:
Out, ye rogue! Play out the play. I have much to say in the
behalf of that Falstaff.
HOST:
O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
PRINCE:
Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!
What's the matter?
HOST:
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come
to search the house. Shall I let them in?
FAL:
Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a
counterfeit. Thou art essentially mad without seeming so.
PRINCE:
And thou a natural coward without instinct.
FAL:
I deny your major. If you will deny the sheriff, so; if not,
let him enter. If I become not a cart as well as another man, a
plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled
with a halter as another.
PRINCE:
Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk, up above.
Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.
FAL:
Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore
I'll hide me.
PRINCE:
Call in the sheriff.
Now, Master Sheriff, what is your will with me?
SHER:
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Hath followed certain men unto this house.
PRINCE:
What men?
SHER:
One of them is well known, my gracious lord-
A gross fat man.
CARRIER:
As fat as butter.
PRINCE:
The man, I do assure you, is not here,
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
That I will by to-morrow dinner time
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For anything he shall be charg'd withal;
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
SHER:
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
PRINCE:
It may be so. If he have robb'd these men,
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
SHER:
Good night, my noble lord.
PRINCE:
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
SHER:
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
PRINCE:
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go call him
forth.
PETO:
Falstaff! Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a
horse.
PRINCE:
Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
What hast thou found?
PETO:
Nothing but papers, my lord.
PRINCE:
Let's see whit they be. Read them.
PETO:
[reads] 'Item. A capon. . . . . . . . . . . . .
PRINCE:
O monstrous! but one halfpennyworth of bread to this
intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close; we'll
read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I'll to
the court in the morning . We must all to the wars. and thy place
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of
foot; and I know, his death will be a march of twelve score. The
money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes
in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto.
PETO:
Good morrow, good my lord.
MORT:
These promises are fair, the parties sure,
And our induction full of prosperous hope.
HOT:
Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
Will you sit down?
And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it!
I have forgot the map.
GLEND:
No, here it is.
Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale, and with
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
HOT:
And you in hell, as oft as he hears
Owen Glendower spoke of.
GLEND:
I cannot blame him. At my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
Of burning cressets, and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shak'd like a coward.
HOT:
Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your
mother's cat had but kitten'd, though yourself had never been
born.
GLEND:
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
HOT:
And I say the earth was not of my mind,
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
GLEND:
The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
HOT:
O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
And not in fear of your nativity.
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,
Shakes the old beldame earth and topples down
Steeples and mossgrown towers. At your birth
Our grandam earth, having this distemp'rature,
In passion shook.
GLEND:
Cousin, of many men
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men.
Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?
And bring him out that is but woman's son
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments.
HOT:
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. I'll to dinner.
MORT:
Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
GLEND:
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
HOT:
Why, so can I, or so can any man;
But will they come when you do call for them?
GLEND:
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.
HOT:
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil-
By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil.
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
MORT:
Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
GLEND:
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
HOT:
Home without boots, and in foul weather too?
How scapes he agues, in the devil's name
GLEND:
Come, here's the map. Shall we divide our right
According to our threefold order ta'en?
MORT:
The Archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally.
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
By south and east is to my part assign'd;
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
And all the fertile land within that bound,
To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you
The remnant northward lying off from Trent.
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
Which being sealed interchangeably
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish bower,
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
My father Glendower is not ready yet,
Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.
GLEND:
A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;
And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
For there will be a world of water shed
Upon the parting of your wives and you.
HOT:
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
In quantity equals not one of yours.
See how this river comes me cranking in
And cuts me from the best of all my land
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
I'll have the current ill this place damm'd up,
And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
In a new channel fair and evenly.
It shall not wind with such a deep indent
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
GLEND:
Not wind? It shall, it must! You see it doth.
MORT:
Yea, but
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
With like advantage on the other side,
Gelding the opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you.
WOR:
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.
HOT:
I'll have it so. A little charge will do it.
GLEND:
I will not have it alt'red.
HOT:
Will not you?
GLEND:
No, nor you shall not.
HOT:
Who shall say me nay?
GLEND:
No, that will I.
HOT:
Let me not understand you then; speak it in Welsh.
GLEND:
I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
For I was train'd up in the English court,
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well,
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-
A virtue that was never seen in you.
HOT:
Marry,
And I am glad of it with all my heart!
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Than one of these same metre ballet-mongers.
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
Nothing so much as mincing poetry.
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
GLEND:
Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
HOT:
I do not care. I'll give thrice so much land
To any well-deserving friend;
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?
GLEND:
The moon shines fair; you may away by night.
I'll haste the writer, and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence.
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
MORT:
Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
HOT:
I cannot choose. Sometimes he angers me
With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
And of a dragon and a finless fish,
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what-
He held me last night at least nine hours
In reckoning up the several devils' names
That were his lackeys. I cried 'hum,' and 'Well, go to!'
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
As a tired horse, a railing wife;
Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
In any summer house in Christendom).
MORT:
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
Exceedingly well read, and profited
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,
And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
When you come 'cross his humour. Faith, he does.
I warrant you that man is not alive
Might so have tempted him as you have done
Without the taste of danger and reproof.
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
WOR:
In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite besides his patience.
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood-
And that's the dearest grace it renders you-
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
Defect of manners, want of government,
Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain;
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth men's hearts, and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
Beguiling them of commendation.
HOT:
Well, I am school'd. Good manners be your speed!
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
MORT:
This is the deadly spite that angers me-
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
GLEND:
My daughter weeps; she will not part with you;
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
MORT:
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
GLEND:
She is desperate here. A peevish self-will'd harlotry,
One that no persuasion can do good upon.
MORT:
I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh
Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
In such a Barley should I answer thee.
I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,
And that's a feeling disputation.
But I will never be a truant, love,
Till I have learnt thy language: for thy tongue
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r,
With ravishing division, to her lute.
GLEND:
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
MORT:
O, I am ignorance itself in this!
GLEND:
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
As is the difference betwixt day and night
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
Begins his golden progress in the East.
MORT:
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing.
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.
GLEND:
Do so,
And those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
And straight they shall be here. Sit, and attend.
HOT:
Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down. Come, quick,
quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
LADY P:
Go, ye giddy goose.
HOT:
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.
By'r Lady, he is a good musician.
LADY P:
Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are
altogether govern'd by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the
lady sing in Welsh.
HOT:
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
LADY P:
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
HOT:
No.
LADY P:
Then be still.
HOT:
Neither! 'Tis a woman's fault.
LADY P:
Now God help thee!
HOT:
To the Welsh lady's bed.
LADY P:
What's that?
HOT:
Peace! she sings.
Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
LADY P:
Not mine, in good sooth.
HOT:
Not yours, in good sooth? Heart! you swear like a
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth!' and 'as true as I
live!' and 'as God shall mend me!' and 'as sure as day!'
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury.
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
And such protest of pepper gingerbread
To velvet guards and Sunday citizens. Come, sing.
LADY P:
I will not sing.
HOT:
'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast-teacher. An
the indentures be drawn, I'll away within these two hours; and so
come in when ye will.
GLEND:
Come, come, Lord Mortimer. You are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
And then to horse immediately.
MORT:
With all my heart.
KING:
Lords, give us leave. The Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
For we shall presently have need of you.
I know not whether God will have it so,
For some displeasing service I have done,
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Could such inordinate and low desires,
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
Such barren pleasures, rude society,
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
PRINCE:
So please your Majesty, I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal.
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
By, smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
I may, for some things true wherein my youth
Hath faulty wand'red and irregular,
And pardon on lily true submission.
KING:
God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,
At thy affections, which do hold a wing,
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood.
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment,
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
But, like a comet, I Was wond'red at;
That men would tell their children, 'This is he!'
Others would say, 'Where? Which is Bolingbroke?'
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dress'd myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
Even in the presence of the crowned King.
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Ne'er seen but wond'red at; and so my state,
Seldom but sumptuous, show'd like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity.
The skipping King, he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state;
Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools;
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance, against his name,
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative;
Grew a companion to the common streets,
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
That, being dally swallowed by men's eyes,
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much.
So, when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded- seen, but with such eyes
As, sick and blunted with community,
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
Such as is bent on unlike majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down,
Slept in his face, and rend'red such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation. Not an eye
But is aweary of thy common sight,
Save mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more;
Which now doth that I would not have it do-
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
PRINCE:
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
Be more myself.
KING:
For all the world,
As thou art to this hour, was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh;
And even as I was then is Percy now.
Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou, the shadow of succession;
For of no right, nor colour like to right,
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
And, Being no more in debt to years than thou,
Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honour hath he got
Against renowmed Douglas! whose high deeds,
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,
Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer
Capitulate against us and are up.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Which art my nearest and dearest enemy'
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
To fight against me under Percy's pay,
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.
PRINCE:
Do not think so. You shall not find it so.
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
When I will wear a garment all of blood,
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
That this same child of honour and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
For every honour sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! For the time will come
That I shall make this Northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
And I will call hall to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This in the name of God I promise here;
The which if he be pleas'd I shall perform,
I do beseech your Majesty may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.
If not, the end
LORD BARDOLPH:
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
Where is the Earl?
PORTER:
What shall I say you are?
LORD BARDOLPH:
Tell thou the Earl
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
PORTER:
His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard.
Please it your honour knock but at the gate,
And he himself will answer.
LORD BARDOLPH:
Here comes the Earl.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now
Should be the father of some stratagem.
The times are wild; contention, like a horse
Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
And bears down all before him.
LORD BARDOLPH:
Noble Earl,
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Good, an God will!
LORD BARDOLPH:
As good as heart can wish.
The King is almost wounded to the death;
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,
So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
Came not till now to dignify the times,
Since Cxsar's fortunes!
NORTHUMBERLAND:
How is this deriv'd?
Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?
LORD BARDOLPH:
I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence;
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
That freely rend'red me these news for true.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
On Tuesday last to listen after news.
LORD BARDOLPH:
My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
And he is furnish'd with no certainties
More than he haply may retail from me.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
TRAVERS:
My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.
He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
With that he gave his able horse the head
And, bending forward, struck his armed heels
Against the panting sides of his poor jade
Up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
He seem'd in running to devour the way,
Staying no longer question.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Ha! Again:
Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion
Had met ill luck?
LORD BARDOLPH:
My lord, I'll tell you what:
If my young lord your son have not the day,
Upon mine honour, for a silken point
I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
Give then such instances of loss?
LORD BARDOLPH:
Who- he?
He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
The horse he rode on and, upon my life,
Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
MORTON:
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
To fright our party.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
How doth my son and brother?
Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
So dull, so dread in look, so woe-begone,
Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus;
Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'-
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
But in the end
CANTERBURY:
My lord, I'll tell you: that self bill is urg'd
ELY:
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
CANTERBURY:
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
ELY:
This would drink deep.
CANTERBURY:
'T would drink the cup and all.
ELY:
But what prevention?
CANTERBURY:
The King is full of grace and fair regard.
ELY:
And a true lover of the holy Church.
CANTERBURY:
The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
ELY:
We are blessed in the change.
CANTERBURY:
Hear him but reason in divinity,
ELY:
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
CANTERBURY:
It must be so; for miracles are ceas'd;
ELY:
But, my good lord,
CANTERBURY:
He seems indifferent
ELY:
How did this offer seem receiv'd, my lord?
CANTERBURY:
With good acceptance of his Majesty;
ELY:
What was th' impediment that broke this off?
CANTERBURY:
The French ambassador upon that instant
ELY:
It is.
CANTERBURY:
Then go we in, to know his embassy;
ELY:
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
KING HENRY:
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
EXETER:
Not here in presence.
KING HENRY:
Send for him, good uncle.
WESTMORELAND:
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
KING HENRY:
Not yet, my cousin; we would be resolv'd,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
CANTERBURY:
God and his angels guard your sacred throne,
And make you long become it!
KING HENRY:
Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique, that they have in France,
Or should or should not bar us in our claim;
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many, now in health,
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war-
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,
'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
That makes such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.
CANTERBURY:
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives, and services,
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your Highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond:
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'-
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land';
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law: to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land;
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear the Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France;
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly suppos'd the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth-
Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught-
Convey'd himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the Crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
King Pepin's title, and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and tide of the female;
So do the kings of France unto this day,
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your Highness claiming from the female;
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked tides
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
KING HENRY:
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
CANTERBURY:
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,
Look back into your mighty ancestors.
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the fun power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English, that could entertain
With half their forces the full pride of France,
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!
ELY:
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
EXETER:
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.
WESTMORELAND:
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might-
So hath your Highness; never King of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
CANTERBURY:
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right!
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.
KING HENRY:
We must not only arm t' invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
With all advantages.
CANTERBURY:
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
KING HENRY:
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
With ample and brim fulness of his force,
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns;
That England, being empty of defence,
Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood.
CANTERBURY:
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France,
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings,
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.
WESTMORELAND:
But there's a saying, very old and true:
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
EXETER:
It follows, then, the cat must stay at home;
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
Th' advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high, and low, and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.
CANTERBURY:
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed as an aim or but
Obedience; for so work the honey bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king, and officers of sorts,
Where some like magistrates correct at home;
Others like merchants venture trade abroad;
Others like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously;
As many arrows loosed several ways
Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town,
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea,
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So many a thousand actions, once afoot,
End in one purpose, and be all well home
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried, and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.
KING HENRY:
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolv'd; and, by God's help
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Or break it all to pieces; or there we'll sit,
Ruling in large and ample empery
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Tombless, with no remembrance over them.
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him, not from the King.
AMBASSADOR:
May't please your Majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far of
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
KING HENRY:
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fett'red in our prisons;
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
AMBASSADOR:
Thus then, in few.
Your Highness, lately sending into France,
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
In answer of which claim, the Prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth,
And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
KING HENRY:
What treasure, uncle?
EXETER:
Tennis-balls, my liege.
KING HENRY:
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
We will in France, by God's grace, play a set
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chaces. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valu'd this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness,
When I do rouse me in my throne of France;
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days;
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones, and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name,
Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
EXETER:
This was a merry message.
KING HENRY:
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
That may give furth'rance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France,
Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected, and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness ad
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought
That this fair action may on foot be brought.
CHORUS:
Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man;
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits Expectation in the air,
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial, crowns, and coronets,
Promis'd to Harry and his followers.
The French, advis'd by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England! model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men-
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Have, for the gilt of France- O guilt indeed!-
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die-
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Ere he take ship for France- and in Southampton.
Linger your patience on, and we'll digest
Th' abuse of distance, force a play.
The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,
The King is set from London, and the scene
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
There is the play-house now, there must you sit,
And thence to France shall we convey you safe
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
But, till the King come forth, and not till then,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
BARDOLPH:
Well met, Corporal Nym.
NYM:
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
BARDOLPH:
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
NYM:
For my part, I care not; I say little, but when time shall
serve, there shall be smiles- but that shall be as it may. I dare
not fight; but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple
one; but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will endure
cold as another man's sword will; and there's an end.
BARDOLPH:
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and we'll
be all three sworn brothers to France. Let't be so, good Corporal
Nym.
NYM:
Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of it;
and when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my
rest, that is the rendezvous of it.
BARDOLPH:
It is certain, Corporal, that he is married to Nell
Quickly; and certainly she did you wrong, for you were
troth-plight to her.
NYM:
I cannot tell; things must be as they may. Men may sleep, and
they may have their throats about them at that time; and some say
knives have edges. It must be as it may; though patience be a
tired mare, yet she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
cannot tell.
BARDOLPH:
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be
patient here.
NYM:
How now, mine host Pistol!
PISTOL:
Base tike, call'st thou me host?
Now by this hand, I swear I scorn the term;
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
HOSTESS:
No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a
dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of
their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house
straight. O well-a-day, Lady, if he be not drawn! Now
we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
BARDOLPH:
Good Lieutenant, good Corporal, offer nothing here.
NYM:
Pish!
PISTOL:
Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of
Iceland!
HOSTESS:
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
NYM:
Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
PISTOL:
'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy;
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
And flashing fire will follow.
NYM:
I am not Barbason: you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to
knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I
will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms; if you
would walk off I would prick your guts a little, in good terms,
as I may, and thaes the humour of it.
PISTOL:
O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
The grave doth gape and doting death is near;
Therefore exhale.
BARDOLPH:
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first
stroke I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
PISTOL:
An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give;
Thy spirits are most tall.
NYM:
I will cut thy throat one time or other, in fair terms; that
is the humour of it.
PISTOL:
'Couple a gorge!'
That is the word. I thee defy again.
O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
No; to the spital go,
And from the powd'ring tub of infamy
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse.
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
For the only she; and- pauca, there's enough.
Go to.
BOY:
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master; and your
hostess- he is very sick, and would to bed. Good Bardolph, put
thy face between his sheets, and do the office of a warming-pan.
Faith, he's very ill.
BARDOLPH:
Away, you rogue.
HOSTESS:
By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these
days: the King has kill'd his heart. Good husband, come home
presently.
BARDOLPH:
Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France
together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one
another's throats?
PISTOL:
Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
NYM:
You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL:
Base is the slave that pays.
NYM:
That now I will have; that's the humour of it.
PISTOL:
As manhood shall compound: push home.
BARDOLPH:
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill
him; by this sword, I will.
PISTOL:
Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
BARDOLPH:
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an
thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me too. Prithee put up.
NYM:
I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
PISTOL:
A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.
I'll live by Nym and Nym shall live by me.
Is not this just? For I shall sutler be
Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
Give me thy hand.
NYM:
[Sheathing his sword] I shall have my noble?
PISTOL:
In cash most justly paid.
NYM:
[Shaking hands] Well, then, that's the humour of't.
HOSTESS:
As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.
Ah, poor heart! he is so shak'd of a burning quotidian tertian
that it is most lamentable to behold. Sweet men, come to him.
NYM:
The King hath run bad humours on the knight; that's the even
of it.
PISTOL:
Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
His heart is fracted and corroborate.
NYM:
The King is a good king, but it must be as it may; he passes
some humours and careers.
PISTOL:
Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins, we will live.
BEDFORD:
Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
EXETER:
They shall be apprehended by and by.
WESTMORELAND:
How smooth and even they do bear themselves,
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty!
BEDFORD:
The King hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.
EXETER:
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours-
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery!
KING HENRY:
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?
SCROOP:
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
KING HENRY:
I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours;
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us.
CAMBRIDGE:
Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
Than is your Majesty. There's not, I think, a subject
That sits in heart-grief and uneasines
Under the sweet shade of your government.
GREY:
True: those that were your father's enemies
Have steep'd their galls in honey, and do serve you
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
KING HENRY:
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
And shall forget the office of our hand
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness.
SCROOP:
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
To do your Grace incessant services.
KING HENRY:
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
Enlarge the man committed yesterday
That rail'd against our person. We consider
It was excess of wine that set him on;
And on his more advice we pardon him.
SCROOP:
That's mercy, but too much security.
Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
KING HENRY:
O, let us yet be merciful!
CAMBRIDGE:
So may your Highness, and yet punish too.
GREY:
Sir,
You show great mercy if you give him life,
After the taste of much correction.
KING HENRY:
Alas, your too much love and care of me
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
If little faults proceeding on distemper
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person,
Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:
Who are the late commissioners?
CAMBRIDGE:
I one, my lord.
Your Highness bade me ask for it to-day.
SCROOP:
So did you me, my liege.
GREY:
And I, my royal sovereign.
KING HENRY:
Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, Sir Knight,
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours.
Read them, and know I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
We will aboard to-night. Why, how now, gentlemen?
What see you in those papers, that you lose
So much complexion? Look ye how they change!
Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
That have so cowarded and chas'd your blood
Out of appearance?
CAMBRIDGE:
I do confess my fault,
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.
KING HENRY:
The mercy that was quick in us but late
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers,
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here-
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with an appertinents
Belonging to his honour; and this man
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir'd,
And sworn unto the practices of France
To kill us here in Hampton; to the which
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use-
May it be possible that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural cause
That admiration did not whoop at them;
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder;
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence;
And other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colours, and with forms, being fetch'd
From glist'ring semblances of piety;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back,
And tell the legions 'I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?
Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?
Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?
Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the ear,
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem;
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Another fall of man. Their faults are open.
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practices!
EXETER:
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard Earl
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry Lord Scroop
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey,
SCROOP:
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,
And I repent my fault more than my death;
Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
Although my body pay the price of it.
CAMBRIDGE:
For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended;
But God be thanked for prevention,
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
GREY:
Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,
Prevented from a damned enterprise.
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
KING HENRY:
God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspir'd against our royal person,
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his coffers
Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
His princes and his peers to servitude,
His subjects to oppression and contempt,
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Poor miserable wretches, to your death;
The taste whereof God of his mercy give
You patience to endure, and true repentance
Of all your dear offences. Bear them hence.
Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you as us like glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason, lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings; we doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then, forth, dear countrymen; let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God,
Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance;
No king of England, if not king of France!
HOSTESS:
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to
PISTOL:
No; for my manly heart doth earn.
Bardolph, be blithe; Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins;
Boy, bristle thy courage up. For Falstaff he is dead,
And we must earn therefore.
BARDOLPH:
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
heaven or in hell!
HOSTESS:
Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's bosom, if
ever man went to Arthur's bosom. 'A made a finer end, and went
away an it had been any christom child; 'a parted ev'n just
between twelve and one, ev'n at the turning o' th' tide; for
after I saw him fumble with the sheets, and play with flowers,
and smile upon his fingers' end, I knew there was but one way;
for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and 'a babbl'd of green
fields. 'How now, Sir John!' quoth I 'What, man, be o' good
cheer.' So 'a cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four times. Now
I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not think of God; I hop'd
there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.
So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his feet; I put my hand into
the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I
felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold
as any stone.
NYM:
They say he cried out of sack.
HOSTESS:
Ay, that 'a did.
BARDOLPH:
And of women.
HOSTESS:
Nay, that 'a did not.
BOY:
Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate.
HOSTESS:
'A could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never
liked.
BOY:
'A said once the devil would have him about women.
HOSTESS:
'A did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was
rheumatic, and talk'd of the Whore of Babylon.
BOY:
Do you not remember 'a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose,
and 'a said it was a black soul burning in hell?
BARDOLPH:
Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's
all the riches I got in his service.
NYM:
Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.
PISTOL:
Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
Look to my chattles and my moveables;
Let senses rule. The word is 'Pitch and Pay.'
Trust none;
For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.
Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys,
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.
BOY:
And that's but unwholesome food, they say.
PISTOL:
Touch her soft mouth and march.
BARDOLPH:
Farewell, hostess.
NYM:
I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu.
PISTOL:
Let housewifery appear; keep close, I thee command.
HOSTESS:
Farewell; adieu.
FRENCH KING:
Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine,
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us, then, to be as provident
As fear may teach us, out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.
DAUPHIN:
My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say, 'tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France;
And let us do it with no show of fear-
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance;
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.
CONSTABLE:
O peace, Prince Dauphin!
You are too much mistaken in this king.
Question your Grace the late ambassadors
With what great state he heard their embassy,
How well supplied with noble counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution,
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.
DAUPHIN:
Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable;
But though we think it so, it is no matter.
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems;
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak and niggardly projection
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.
FRENCH KING:
Think we King Harry strong;
And, Princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths.
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
And all our princes capdv'd by the hand
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
Whiles that his mountain sire- on mountain standing,
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun-
Saw his heroical seed, and smil'd to see him,
Mangle the work of nature, and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made. This is a stern
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him.
MESSENGER:
Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your Majesty.
FRENCH KING:
We'll give them present audience. Go and bring them.
You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.
DAUPHIN:
Turn head and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.
FRENCH KING:
From our brother of England?
EXETER:
From him, and thus he greets your Majesty:
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, 'longs
To him and to his heirs- namely, the crown,
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain,
By custom and the ordinance of times,
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd,
He sends you this most memorable line,
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing you overlook this pedigree.
And when you find him evenly deriv'd
From his most fam'd of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him, the native and true challenger.
FRENCH KING:
Or else what follows?
EXETER:
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
That if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown; and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
The dead men's blood, the privy maidens' groans,
For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threat'ning, and my message;
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
FRENCH KING:
For us, we will consider of this further;
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother of England.
DAUPHIN:
For the Dauphin:
I stand here for him. What to him from England?
EXETER:
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
And anything that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king: an if your father's Highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordinance.
DAUPHIN:
Say, if my father render fair return,
It is against my will; for I desire
Nothing but odds with England. To that end,
As matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls.
EXETER:
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe;
And be assur'd you'll find a difference,
As we his subjects have in wonder found,
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain; that you shall read
In your own losses, if he stay in France.
FRENCH KING:
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
EXETER:
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.
FRENCH KING:
You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions.
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence.
CHORUS:
Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies,
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed King at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phorbus fanning.
Play with your fancies; and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confus'd; behold the threaden sails,
Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,
Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think
You stand upon the rivage and behold
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
And leave your England as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance;
For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
With one appearing hair that will not follow
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose th' ambassador from the French comes back;
Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
Katherine his daughter, and with her to dowry
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes not; and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.
KING:
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger:
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let it pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon: let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide;
Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof-
Fathers that like so many Alexanders
Have in these parts from morn till even fought,
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding- which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit; and upon this charge
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'
BARDOLPH:
On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
NYM:
Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for
mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is too
hot; that is the very plain-song of it.
PISTOL:
The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound:
BOY:
Would I were in an alehouse in London! I wouid give all my
fame for a pot of ale and safety.
PISTOL:
And I:
BOY:
As duly, but not as truly,
FLUELLEN:
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
PISTOL:
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage;
Abate thy rage, great duke.
Good bawcock, bate thy rage. Use lenity, sweet chuck.
NYM:
These be good humours. Your honour wins bad humours.
BOY:
As young as I am, I have observ'd these three swashers. I am
boy to them all three; but all they three, though they would
serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do
not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver'd and
red-fac'd; by the means whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not.
For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the
means whereof 'a breaks words and keeps whole weapons. For Nym,
he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought
a coward; but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
deeds; for 'a never broke any man's head but his own, and that
was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything,
and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve
leagues, and sold it for three halfpence. Nym and Bardolph are
sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel; I knew by that piece of service the men would carry
coals. They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their
gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my
manhood, if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine;
for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them and
seek some better service; their villainy goes against my weak
stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.
GOWER:
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines; the
Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
FLUELLEN:
To the mines! Tell you the Duke it is not so good to come
to the mines; for, look you, the mines is not according to the
disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not sufficient.
For, look you, th' athversary- you may discuss unto the Duke,
look you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines; by
Cheshu, I think 'a will plow up all, if there is not better
directions.
GOWER:
The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is
given, is altogether directed by an Irishman- a very vallant
gentleman, i' faith.
FLUELLEN:
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
GOWER:
I think it be.
FLUELLEN:
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will verify
as much in his beard; he has no more directions in the true
disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than
is a puppy-dog.
GOWER:
Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with
him.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman, that is
certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient
wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu,
he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the
world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.
JAMY:
I say gud day, Captain Fluellen.
FLUELLEN:
God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
GOWER:
How now, Captain Macmorris! Have you quit the mines? Have
the pioneers given o'er?
MACMORRIS:
By Chrish, la, tish ill done! The work ish give over,
the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my
father's soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give over; I would
have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O,
tish ill done, tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe
me, look you, a few disputations with you, as partly touching or
concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way
of argument, look you, and friendly communication; partly to
satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of
my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline,
that is the point.
JAMY:
It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath; and I sall
quit you with gud leve, as I may pick occasion; that sall I,
marry.
MACMORRIS:
It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day
is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the King, and the
Dukes; it is no time to discourse. The town is beseech'd, and the
trumpet call us to the breach; and we talk and, be Chrish, do
nothing. 'Tis shame for us all, so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
stand still; it is shame, by my hand; and there is throats to be
cut, and works to be done; and there ish nothing done, so Chrish
sa' me, la.
JAMY:
By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to
slomber, ay'll de gud service, or I'll lig i' th' grund for it;
ay, or go to death. And I'll pay't as valorously as I may, that
sall I suerly do, that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad
full fain heard some question 'tween you tway.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
correction, there is not many of your nation-
MACMORRIS:
Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a
bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish my nation? Who talks
of my nation?
FLUELLEN:
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant,
Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me
with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, look
you; being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
war and in the derivation of my birth, and in other
particularities.
MACMORRIS:
I do not know you so good a man as myself; so
Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
GOWER:
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
JAMY:
Ah! that's a foul fault.
GOWER:
The town sounds a parley.
FLUELLEN:
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity
to be required, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know
the disciplines of war; and there is an end.
KING HENRY:
How yet resolves the Governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit;
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
Or, like to men proud of destruction,
Defy us to our worst; for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the batt'ry once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.
What is it then to me if impious war,
Array'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
What is't to me when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickednes
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil,
As send precepts to the Leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.
If not- why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls;
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? Will you yield, and this avoid?
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
GOVERNOR:
Our expectation hath this day an end:
The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated,
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King,
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
For we no longer are defensible.
KING HENRY:
Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French;
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
The winter coming on, and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest;
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.
KATHERINE:
Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le
langage.
ALICE:
Un peu, madame.
KATHERINE:
Je te prie, m'enseignez; il faut que j'apprenne a
parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglais?
ALICE:
La main? Elle est appelee de hand.
KATHERINE:
De hand. Et les doigts?
ALICE:
Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me
souviendrai. Les doigts? Je pense qu'ils sont appeles de fingres;
oui, de fingres.
KATHERINE:
La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense que
je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots d'Anglais vitement.
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
ALICE:
Les ongles? Nous les appelons de nails.
KATHERINE:
De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi si je parle bien: de hand,
de fingres, et de nails.
ALICE:
C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglais.
KATHERINE:
Dites-moi l'Anglais pour le bras.
ALICE:
De arm, madame.
KATHERINE:
Et le coude?
ALICE:
D'elbow.
KATHERINE:
D'elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les mots que
vous m'avez appris des a present.
ALICE:
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
KATHERINE:
Excusez-moi, Alice; ecoutez: d'hand, de fingre, de
nails, d'arma, de bilbow.
ALICE:
D'elbow, madame.
KATHERINE:
O Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie! D'elbow.
Comment appelez-vous le col?
ALICE:
De nick, madame.
KATHERINE:
De nick. Et le menton?
ALICE:
De chin.
KATHERINE:
De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin.
ALICE:
Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots
aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
KATHERINE:
Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de Dieu, et
en peu de temps.
ALICE:
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
KATHERINE:
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: d'hand, de fingre,
de mails-
ALICE:
De nails, madame.
KATHERINE:
De nails, de arm, de ilbow.
ALICE:
Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.
KATHERINE:
Ainsi dis-je; d'elbow, de nick, et de sin. Comment
appelez-vous le pied et la robe?
ALICE:
Le foot, madame; et le count.
KATHERINE:
Le foot et le count. O Seigneur Dieu! ils sont mots de
son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les
dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant
les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le
count! Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble:
d'hand, de fingre, de nails, d'arm, d'elbow, de nick, de sin, de
foot, le count.
ALICE:
Excellent, madame!
KATHERINE:
C'est assez pour une fois: allons-nous a diner.
FRENCH KING:
'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.
CONSTABLE:
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
Let us not live in France; let us quit an,
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
DAUPHIN:
O Dieu vivant! Shall a few sprays of us,
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
And overlook their grafters?
BRITAINE:
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
Mort Dieu, ma vie! if they march along
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom
To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
CONSTABLE:
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull;
On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields-
Poor we call them in their native lords!
DAUPHIN:
By faith and honour,
Our madams mock at us and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out, and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.
BRITAINE:
They bid us to the English dancing-schools
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,
Saying our grace is only in our heels
And that we are most lofty runaways.
FRENCH KING:
Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence;
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, Princes, and, with spirit of honour edged
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France;
You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
Alengon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconbridge,
Foix, Lestrake, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and knights,
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
Rush on his host as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon;
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.
CONSTABLE:
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march;
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
And for achievement offer us his ransom.
FRENCH KING:
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy,
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
DAUPHIN:
Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.
FRENCH KING:
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, Lord Constable and Princes all,
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.
GOWER:
How now, Captain Fluellen! Come you from the bridge?
FLUELLEN:
I assure you there is very excellent services committed
at the bridge.
GOWER:
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
FLUELLEN:
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a
man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my
duty, and my live, and my living, and my uttermost power. He is
not- God be praised and blessed!- any hurt in the world, but
keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There
is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my
very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is
man of no estimation in the world; but I did see him do as
gallant service.
GOWER:
What do you call him?
FLUELLEN:
He is call'd Aunchient Pistol.
GOWER:
I know him not.
FLUELLEN:
Here is the man.
PISTOL:
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours.
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
FLUELLEN:
Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at his
hands.
PISTOL:
Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
And of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
That goddess blind,
That stands upon the rolling restless stone-
FLUELLEN:
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted
blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to signify to you that
Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to
signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning,
and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look
you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and
rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description
of it: Fortune is an excellent moral.
PISTOL:
Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
For he hath stol'n a pax, and hanged must 'a be-
A damned death!
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free,
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price.
Therefore, go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice;
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach.
Speak, Captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
FLUELLEN:
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
PISTOL:
Why then, rejoice therefore.
FLUELLEN:
Certainly, Aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at;
for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to
use his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline
ought to be used.
PISTOL:
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!
FLUELLEN:
It is well.
PISTOL:
The fig of Spain!
FLUELLEN:
Very good.
GOWER:
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I remember him
now- a bawd, a cutpurse.
FLUELLEN:
I'll assure you, 'a utt'red as prave words at the pridge
as you shall see in a summer's day. But it is very well; what he
has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.
GOWER:
Why, 'tis a gull a fool a rogue, that now and then goes to
the wars to grace himself, at his return into London, under the
form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfect in the great
commanders' names; and they will learn you by rote where services
were done- at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a
convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what
terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in the
phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what
a beard of the General's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will
do among foaming bottles and ale-wash'd wits is wonderful to be
thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age,
or else you may be marvellously mistook.
FLUELLEN:
I tell you what, Captain Gower, I do perceive he is not
the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is; if I
find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind.
Hark you, the King is coming; and I must speak with him from the
pridge.
God pless your Majesty!
KING HENRY:
How now, Fluellen! Cam'st thou from the bridge?
FLUELLEN:
Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very
gallantly maintain'd the pridge; the French is gone off, look
you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th'
athversary was have possession of the pridge; but he is enforced
to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge; I can
tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man.
KING HENRY:
What men have you lost, Fluellen!
FLUELLEN:
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great,
reasonable great; marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost
never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a
church- one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man; his face is
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire; and his
lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes
plue and sometimes red; but his nose is executed and his fire's
out.
KING HENRY:
We would have all such offenders so cut off. And we
give express charge that in our marches through the country there
be nothing compell'd from the villages, nothing taken but paid
for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
MONTJOY:
You know me by my habit.
KING HENRY:
Well then, I know thee; what shall I know of thee?
MONTJOY:
My master's mind.
KING HENRY:
Unfold it.
MONTJOY:
Thus says my king. Say thou to Harry of England: Though we
seem'd dead we did but sleep; advantage is a better soldier than
rashness. Tell him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur, but
that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial:
England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our
sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost,
the disgrace we have digested; which, in weight to re-answer, his
pettiness would bow under. For our losses his exchequer is too
poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom
too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling
at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add
defiance; and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
followers, whose condemnation is pronounc'd. So far my king and
master; so much my office.
KING HENRY:
What is thy name? I know thy quality.
MONTJOY:
Montjoy.
KING HENRY:
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
And tell thy king I do not seek him now,
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment; for, to say the sooth-
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage-
My people are with sickness much enfeebled;
My numbers lessen'd; and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,
That I do brag thus; this your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am;
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk;
My army but a weak and sickly guard;
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
Go, bid thy master well advise himself.
If we may pass, we will; if we be hind'red,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle as we are;
Nor as we are, we say, we will not shun it.
So tell your master.
MONTJOY:
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.
GLOUCESTER:
I hope they will not come upon us now.
KING HENRY:
We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge, it now draws toward night;
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
And on to-morrow bid them march away.
CONSTABLE:
Tut! I have the best armour of the world.
Would it were day!
ORLEANS:
You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his
due.
CONSTABLE:
It is the best horse of Europe.
ORLEANS:
Will it never be morning?
DAUPHIN:
My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable, you talk of
horse and armour?
ORLEANS:
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the
world.
DAUPHIN:
What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with
any that treads but on four pasterns. Ca, ha! he bounds from the
earth as if his entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the
Pegasus, chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him I soar, I
am a hawk. He trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it;
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of
Hermes.
ORLEANS:
He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
DAUPHIN:
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus:
he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water
never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his
rider mounts him; he is indeed a horse, and all other jades you
may call beasts.
CONSTABLE:
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
horse.
DAUPHIN:
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
ORLEANS:
No more, cousin.
DAUPHIN:
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of
the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my
palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into
eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all: 'tis a
subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's
sovereign to ride on; and for the world- familiar to us and
unknown- to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at
him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder
of nature'-
ORLEANS:
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
DAUPHIN:
Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser;
for my horse is my mistress.
ORLEANS:
Your mistress bears well.
DAUPHIN:
Me well; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a
good and particular mistress.
CONSTABLE:
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back.
DAUPHIN:
So perhaps did yours.
CONSTABLE:
Mine was not bridled.
DAUPHIN:
O, then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode like a
kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your strait
strossers.
CONSTABLE:
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
DAUPHIN:
Be warn'd by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not
warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my
mistress.
CONSTABLE:
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
DAUPHIN:
I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
CONSTABLE:
I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to
my mistress.
DAUPHIN:
'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et la
truie lavee au bourbier.' Thou mak'st use of anything.
CONSTABLE:
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such
proverb so little kin to the purpose.
RAMBURES:
My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
to-night- are those stars or suns upon it?
CONSTABLE:
Stars, my lord.
DAUPHIN:
Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
CONSTABLE:
And yet my sky shall not want.
DAUPHIN:
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and 'twere
more honour some were away.
CONSTABLE:
Ev'n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as
well were some of your brags dismounted.
DAUPHIN:
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it
never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and my way shall be
paved with English faces.
CONSTABLE:
I will not say so, for fear I should be fac'd out of my
way; but I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the
ears of the English.
RAMBURES:
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
CONSTABLE:
You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them.
DAUPHIN:
'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.
ORLEANS:
The Dauphin longs for morning.
RAMBURES:
He longs to eat the English.
CONSTABLE:
I think he will eat all he kills.
ORLEANS:
By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
CONSTABLE:
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
ORLEANS:
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
CONSTABLE:
Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
ORLEANS:
He never did harm that I heard of.
CONSTABLE:
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name
still.
ORLEANS:
I know him to be valiant.
CONSTABLE:
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
ORLEANS:
What's he?
CONSTABLE:
Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he car'd not
who knew it.
ORLEANS:
He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
CONSTABLE:
By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody saw it but
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
ORLEANS:
Ill-wind never said well.
CONSTABLE:
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in
friendship.'
ORLEANS:
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
CONSTABLE:
Well plac'd! There stands your friend for the devil;
have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of the devil!'
ORLEANS:
You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A fool's bolt
is soon shot.'
CONSTABLE:
You have shot over.
ORLEANS:
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
MESSENGER:
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen
hundred paces of your tents.
CONSTABLE:
Who hath measur'd the ground?
MESSENGER:
The Lord Grandpre.
CONSTABLE:
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day!
Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for the dawning as we
do.
ORLEANS:
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers so far out of his
knowledge!
CONSTABLE:
If the English had any apprehension, they would run
away.
ORLEANS:
That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual
armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.
RAMBURES:
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures;
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
ORLEANS:
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian
bear, and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples! You may as
well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
lip of a lion.
CONSTABLE:
Just, just! and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs
in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their
wives; and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel;
they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
ORLEANS:
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
CONSTABLE:
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to
eat, and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we
about it?
ORLEANS:
It is now two o'clock; but let me see- by ten
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
CHORUS:
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fix'd sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each other's watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents
The armourers accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation.
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do ton,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and over-lusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning's danger; and their gesture sad
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O, now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruin'd band
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
For forth he goes and visits all his host;
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,
And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night;
But freshly looks, and over-bears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks;
A largess universal, like the sun,
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where- O for pity!- we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Right ill-dispos'd in brawl ridiculous,
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Minding true things by what their mock'ries be.
KING HENRY:
Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
Would men observingly distil it out;
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
Which is both healthful and good husbandry.
Besides, they are our outward consciences
And preachers to us all, admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
And make a moral of the devil himself.
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.
ERPINGHAM:
Not so, my liege; this lodging likes me better,
Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'
KING HENRY:
'Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example; so the spirit is eased;
And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
Commend me to the princes in our camp;
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
Desire them all to my pavilion.
GLOUCESTER:
We shall, my liege.
ERPINGHAM:
Shall I attend your Grace?
KING HENRY:
No, my good knight:
Go with my brothers to my lords of England;
I and my bosom must debate awhile,
And then I would no other company.
ERPINGHAM:
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
KING HENRY:
God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.
PISTOL:
Qui va la?
KING HENRY:
A friend.
PISTOL:
Discuss unto me: art thou officer,
Or art thou base, common, and popular?
KING HENRY:
I am a gentleman of a company.
PISTOL:
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
KING HENRY:
Even so. What are you?
PISTOL:
As good a gentleman as the Emperor.
KING HENRY:
Then you are a better than the King.
PISTOL:
The King's a bawcock and a heart of gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
KING HENRY:
Harry le Roy.
PISTOL:
Le Roy! a Cornish name; art thou of Cornish crew?
KING HENRY:
No, I am a Welshman.
PISTOL:
Know'st thou Fluellen?
KING HENRY:
Yes.
PISTOL:
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate
Upon Saint Davy's day.
KING HENRY:
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest
he knock that about yours.
PISTOL:
Art thou his friend?
KING HENRY:
And his kinsman too.
PISTOL:
The figo for thee, then!
KING HENRY:
I thank you; God be with you!
PISTOL:
My name is Pistol call'd.
KING HENRY:
It sorts well with your fierceness.
GOWER:
Captain Fluellen!
FLUELLEN:
So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the
greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept: if you
would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great,
you shall find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle-taddle nor
pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you, you shall find the
ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it,
and the sobriety of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.
GOWER:
Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.
FLUELLEN:
If the enemy is an ass, and a fool, and a prating
coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be
an ass, and a fool, and a prating coxcomb? In your own
conscience, now?
GOWER:
I will speak lower.
FLUELLEN:
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
KING HENRY:
Though it appear a little out of fashion,
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.
COURT:
Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks
yonder?
BATES:
I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the
approach of day.
WILLIAMS:
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we
shall never see the end
BEDFORD:
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to
night! Comets, importing change of times and states,
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
That have consented unto Henry's death!
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
GLOUCESTER:
England ne'er had a king until his time.
Virtue he had, deserving to command;
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams;
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
More dazzled and drove back his enemies
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
EXETER:
We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?
Henry is dead and never shall revive.
Upon a wooden coffin we attend;
And death's dishonourable victory
We with our stately presence glorify,
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
By magic verses have contriv'd his end?
WINCHESTER:
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings;
Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought;
The Church's prayers made him so prosperous.
GLOUCESTER:
The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen
pray'd,
His thread of life had not so soon decay'd.
None do you like but an effeminate prince,
Whom like a school-boy you may overawe.
WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art
Protector
And lookest to command the Prince and realm.
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe
More than God or religious churchmen may.
GLOUCESTER:
Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh;
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
Except it be to pray against thy foes.
BEDFORD:
Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace;
Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.
Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms,
Since arms avail not, now that Henry's dead.
Posterity, await for wretched years,
When at their mothers' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck,
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
And none but women left to wail the dead.
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens.
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright
MESSENGER:
My honourable lords, health to you all!
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
BEDFORD:
What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
GLOUCESTER:
Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?
If Henry were recall'd to life again,
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
EXETER:
How were they lost? What treachery was us'd?
MESSENGER:
No treachery, but want of men and money.
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
That here you maintain several factions;
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
You are disputing of your generals:
One would have ling'ring wars, with little cost;
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
A third thinks, without expense at all,
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
Awake, awake, English nobility!
Let not sloth dim your honours, new-begot.
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
Of England's coat one half is cut away.
EXETER:
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
BEDFORD:
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
Give me my steeled coat; I'll fight for France.
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
To weep their intermissive miseries.
SECOND MESSENGER:
Lords, view these letters full of bad
mischance.
France is revolted from the English quite,
Except some petty towns of no import.
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
EXETER:
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
GLOUCESTER:
We will not fly but to our enemies' throats.
Bedford, if thou be slack I'll fight it out.
BEDFORD:
Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
Wherewith already France is overrun.
THIRD MESSENGER:
My gracious lords, to add to your
laments,
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
I must inform you of a dismal fight
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
WINCHESTER:
What! Wherein Talbot overcame? Is't so?
THIRD MESSENGER:
O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was
o'erthrown.
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompassed and set upon.
No leisure had he to enrank his men;
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
They pitched in the ground confusedly
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
More than three hours the fight continued;
Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
Here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew
The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
All the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
'A Talbot! a Talbot!' cried out amain,
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
He, being in the vaward plac'd behind
With purpose to relieve and follow them-
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre.
Enclosed were they with their enemies.
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back;
Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,
Durst not presume to look once in the face.
BEDFORD:
Is Talbot slain? Then I will slay myself,
For living idly here in pomp and ease,
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
THIRD MESSENGER:
O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,
And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
BEDFORD:
His ransom there is none but I shall pay.
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne;
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal.
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake.
THIRD MESSENGER:
So you had need; for Orleans is besieg'd;
The English army is grown weak and faint;
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
EXETER:
Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
BEDFORD:
I do remember it, and here take my leave
To go about my preparation.
GLOUCESTER:
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can
To view th' artillery and munition;
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
EXETER:
To Eltham will I, where the young King is,
Being ordain'd his special governor;
And for his safety there I'll best devise.
WINCHESTER:
[Aside]
attend:
I am left out; for me nothing remains.
But long I will not be Jack out of office.
The King from Eltham I intend to steal,
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
CHARLES:
Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
So in the earth, to this day is not known.
Late did he shine upon the English side;
Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.
What towns of any moment but we have?
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
ALENCON:
They want their porridge and their fat bull
beeves.
Either they must be dieted like mules
And have their provender tied to their mouths,
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
REIGNIER:
Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here?
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
CHARLES:
Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
Him I forgive my death that killeth me,
When he sees me go back one foot or flee.
CHARLES:
Who ever saw the like? What men have I!
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled
But that they left me midst my enemies.
REIGNIER:
Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
He fighteth as one weary of his life.
The other lords, like lions wanting food,
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
ALENCON:
Froissart, a countryman of ours, records
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
During the time Edward the Third did reign.
More truly now may this be verified;
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
Lean raw-bon'd rascals! Who would e'er suppose
They had such courage and audacity?
CHARLES:
Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd
slaves,
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
REIGNIER:
I think by some odd gimmers or device
Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
ALENCON:
Be it so.
BASTARD:
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
CHARLES:
Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
BASTARD:
Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd.
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
Be not dismay'd, for succour is at hand.
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven,
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
What's past and what's to come she can descry.
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
For they are certain and unfallible.
CHARLES:
Go, call her in.
But first, to try her skill,
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
REIGNIER:
Fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
PUCELLE:
Reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
I know thee well, though never seen before.
Be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me.
In private will I talk with thee apart.
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
REIGNIER:
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
PUCELLE:
Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
To shine on my contemptible estate.
Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
God's Mother deigned to appear to me,
And in a vision full of majesty
Will'd me to leave my base vocation
And free my country from calamity
Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success.
In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
And whereas I was black and swart before,
With those clear rays which she infus'd on me
That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see.
Ask me what question thou canst possible,
And I will answer unpremeditated.
My courage try by combat if thou dar'st,
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
CHARLES:
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms.
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me;
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
PUCELLE:
I am prepar'd; here is my keen-edg'd sword,
Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side,
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard,
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
CHARLES:
Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
PUCELLE:
And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man.
CHARLES:
Stay, stay thy hands; thou art an Amazon,
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
PUCELLE:
Christ's Mother helps me, else I were too weak.
CHARLES:
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me.
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd.
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
PUCELLE:
I must not yield to any rites of love,
For my profession's sacred from above.
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
Then will I think upon a recompense.
CHARLES:
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
REIGNIER:
My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
ALENCON:
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
REIGNIER:
Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
ALENCON:
He may mean more than we poor men do know;
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
REIGNIER:
My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
Shall we give o'er Orleans, or no?
PUCELLE:
Why, no, I say; distrustful recreants!
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
CHARLES:
What she says I'll confirm; we'll fight it out.
PUCELLE:
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise.
Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
Since I have entered into these wars.
Glory is like a circle in the water,
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
With Henry's death the English circle ends;
Dispersed are the glories it included.
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
CHARLES:
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee.
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
How may I reverently worship thee enough?
ALENCON:
Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
REIGNIER:
Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
Drive them from Orleans, and be immortaliz'd.
CHARLES:
Presently we'll try. Come, let's away about it.
No prophet will I trust if she prove false.
GLOUCESTER:
I am come to survey the Tower this day;
Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
Where be these warders that they wait not here?
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.
FIRST WARDER:
[Within]
imperiously?
SECOND WARDER:
[Within]
let in.
Protector?
FIRST WARDER:
[Within]
answer him.
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Who willed you, or whose will stands but
mine?
There's none Protector of the realm but I.
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
WOODVILLE:
[Within]
have we here?
GLOUCESTER:
Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
WOODVILLE:
[Within]
not open;
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids.
From him I have express commandment
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
GLOUCESTER:
Faint-hearted Woodville, prizest him fore me?
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook!
Thou art no friend to God or to the King.
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
WINCHESTER:
How now, ambitious Humphry! What means
this?
GLOUCESTER:
Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be
shut out?
WINCHESTER:
I do, thou most usurping proditor,
And not Protector of the King or realm.
GLOUCESTER:
Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord;
Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin.
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
WINCHESTER:
Nay, stand thou back; I will not budge a foot.
This be Damascus; be thou cursed Cain,
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
GLOUCESTER:
I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back.
Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
WINCHESTER:
Do what thou dar'st; I beard thee to thy face.
GLOUCESTER:
What! am I dar'd and bearded to my face?
Draw, men, for all this privileged place
Blue-coats to tawny-coats. Priest, beware your beard;
I mean to tug it, and to cuff you soundly;
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat;
In spite of Pope or dignities of church,
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the
Pope.
GLOUCESTER:
Winchester goose! I cry 'A rope, a rope!'
Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
Out, tawny-coats! Out, scarlet hypocrite!
MAYOR:
Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
GLOUCESTER:
Peace, Mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor King,
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
WINCHESTER:
Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens;
One that still motions war and never peace,
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines;
That seeks to overthrow religion,
Because he is Protector of the realm,
And would have armour here out of the Tower,
To crown himself King and suppress the Prince.
GLOUCESTER:
I Will not answer thee with words, but blows.
MAYOR:
Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife
But to make open proclamation.
Come, officer, as loud as e'er thou canst,
Cry.
OFFICER:
[Cries]
this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge
and command you, in his Highness' name, to repair to
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear, handle, or
use, any sword, weapon, or dagger, henceforward, upon
pain of death.
GLOUCESTER:
Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law;
But we shall meet and break our minds at large.
WINCHESTER:
Gloucester, we'll meet to thy cost, be sure;
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
MAYOR:
I'll call for clubs if you will not away.
This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
GLOUCESTER:
Mayor, farewell; thou dost but what thou
mayst.
WINCHESTER:
Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head,
For I intend to have it ere long.
MAYOR:
See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
I myself fight not once in forty year.
besieg'd,
And how the English have the suburbs won.
BOY:
Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
by me.
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
Something I must do to procure me grace.
The Prince's espials have informed me
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
And thence discover how with most advantage
They may vex us with shot or with assault.
To intercept this inconvenience,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
And even these three days have I watch'd
If I could see them. Now do thou watch,
For I can stay no longer.
If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.
BOY:
Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
SALISBURY:
Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
How wert thou handled being prisoner?
Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd?
Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
TALBOT:
The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
For him was I exchang'd and ransomed.
But with a baser man of arms by far
Once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;
Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
If I now had him brought into my power.
SALISBURY:
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
TALBOT:
With scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
In open market-place produc'd they me
To be a public spectacle to all;
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
Then broke I from the officers that led me,
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
My grisly countenance made others fly;
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
That walk'd about me every minute-while;
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
SALISBURY:
I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd;
But we will be reveng'd sufficiently.
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
Here, through this grate, I count each one
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale,
Let me have your express opinions
Where is best place to make our batt'ry next.
GARGRAVE:
I think at the North Gate; for there stand lords.
GLANSDALE:
And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
TALBOT:
For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
SALISBURY:
O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
GARGRAVE:
O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!
TALBOT:
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
How far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
Yet liv'st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
Thou shalt not die whiles
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
Remember to avenge me on the French.'
Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
Wretched shall France be only in my name.
What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens?
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
MESSENGER:
My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd
head
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
A holy prophetess new risen up,
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
TALBOT:
Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan.
It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd.
Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you.
Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
TALBOT:
Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them;
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee.
Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee;
Blood will I draw on thee-thou art a witch
And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st.
PUCELLE:
Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
TALBOT:
Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage.
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,
But I will chastise this high minded strumpet.
PUCELLE:
Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come.
I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
O'ertake me if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.
Go, go, cheer up thy hungry starved men;
Help Salisbury to make his testament.
This day is ours, as many more shall be.
TALBOT:
My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
I know not where I am nor what I do.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists.
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
Are from their hives and houses driven away.
They call'd us, for our fierceness, English dogs;
Now like to whelps we crying run away.
Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight
Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.
It will not be-retire into your trenches.
You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans
In spite of us or aught that we could do.
O, would I were to die with Salisbury!
The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
PUCELLE:
Advance our waving colours on the walls;
Rescu'd is Orleans from the English.
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
CHARLES:
Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,
How shall I honour thee for this success?
Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens,
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess.
Recover'd is the town of Orleans.
More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
REIGNIER:
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the
town?
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires
And feast and banquet in the open streets
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
ALENCON:
All France will be replete with mirth and joy
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
CHARLES:
'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
For which I will divide my crown with her;
And all the priests and friars in my realm
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
Than Rhodope's of Memphis ever was.
In memory of her, when she is dead,
Her ashes, in an urn more precious
Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius,
Transported shall be at high festivals
Before the kings and queens of France.
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
Come in, and let us banquet royally
After this golden day of victory. Flourish.
SERGEANT:
Sirs, take your places and be vigilant.
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
FIRST SENTINEL:
Sergeant, you shall.
Thus are poor servitors,
When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.
TALBOT:
Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,
By whose approach the regions of Artois,
Wallon, and Picardy, are friends to us,
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
Having all day carous'd and banqueted;
Embrace we then this opportunity,
As fitting best to quittance their deceit,
Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery.
BEDFORD:
Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,
Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,
To join with witches and the help of hell!
BURGUNDY:
Traitors have never other company.
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
TALBOT:
A maid, they say.
BEDFORD:
A maid! and be so martial!
BURGUNDY:
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
If underneath the standard of the French
She carry armour as she hath begun.
TALBOT:
Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:
God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
BEDFORD:
Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.
TALBOT:
Not all together; better far, I guess,
That we do make our entrance several ways;
That if it chance the one of us do fail
The other yet may rise against their force.
BEDFORD:
Agreed; I'll to yond corner.
BURGUNDY:
And I to this.
TALBOT:
And here will Talbot mount or make his grave.
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
Of English Henry, shall this night appear
How much in duty I am bound to both.
SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make assault.
ALENCON:
How now, my lords? What, all unready so?
BASTARD:
Unready! Ay, and glad we 'scap'd so well.
REIGNIER:
'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
Hearing alarums at our chamber doors.
ALENCON:
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
More venturous or desperate than this.
BASTARD:
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
REIGNIER:
If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him
ALENCON:
Here cometh Charles; I marvel how he sped.
BASTARD:
Tut! holy Joan was his defensive guard.
CHARLES:
Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
Make us partakers of a little gain
That now our loss might be ten times so much?
PUCELLE:
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?
At all times will you have my power alike?
Sleeping or waking, must I still prevail
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
Improvident soldiers! Had your watch been good
This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
CHARLES:
Duke of Alencon, this was your default
That, being captain of the watch to-night,
Did look no better to that weighty charge.
ALENCON:
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government,
We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd.
BASTARD:
Mine was secure.
REIGNIER:
And so was mine, my lord.
CHARLES:
And, for myself, most part of all this night,
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
I was employ'd in passing to and fro
About relieving of the sentinels.
Then how or which way should they first break in?
PUCELLE:
Question, my lords, no further of the case,
How or which way; 'tis sure they found some place
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
And now there rests no other shift but this
To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispers'd,
And lay new platforms to endamage them.
SOLDIER:
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
For I have loaden me with many spoils,
Using no other weapon but his name.
BEDFORD:
The day begins to break, and night is fled
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit.
TALBOT:
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury
And here advance it in the market-place,
The middle centre of this cursed town.
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
For every drop of blood was drawn from him
There hath at least five Frenchmen died to-night.
And that hereafter ages may behold
What ruin happened in revenge of him,
Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
Upon the which, that every one may read,
Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans,
The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
And what a terror he had been to France.
But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
Nor any of his false confederates.
BEDFORD:
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
They did amongst the troops of armed men
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
BURGUNDY:
Myself, as far as I could well discern
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull,
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
That could not live asunder day or night.
After that things are set in order here,
We'll follow them with all the power we have.
MESSENGER:
All hail, my lords! Which of this princely train
Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
So much applauded through the realm of France?
TALBOT:
Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him?
MESSENGER:
The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
With modesty admiring thy renown,
By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
To visit her poor castle where she lies,
That she may boast she hath beheld the man
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
BURGUNDY:
Is it even so? Nay, then I see our wars
Will turn into a peaceful comic sport,
When ladies crave to be encount'red with.
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
TALBOT:
Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
Could not prevail with all their oratory,
Yet hath a woman's kindness overrul'd;
And therefore tell her I return great thanks
And in submission will attend on her.
Will not your honours bear me company?
BEDFORD:
No, truly; 'tis more than manners will;
And I have heard it said unbidden guests
Are often welcomest when they are gone.
TALBOT:
Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,
I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
Come hither, Captain. You perceive my mind?
CAPTAIN:
I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.
COUNTESS:
Porter, remember what I gave in charge;
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
PORTER:
Madam, I will.
COUNTESS:
The plot is laid; if all things fall out right,
I shall as famous be by this exploit.
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,
And his achievements of no less account.
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
To give their censure of these rare reports.
Enter MESSENGER and TALBOT.
MESSENGER:
Madam, according as your ladyship desir'd,
By message crav'd, so is Lord Talbot come.
COUNTESS:
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
MESSENGER:
Madam, it is.
COUNTESS:
Is this the scourge of France?
Is this Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false.
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.
TALBOT:
Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
I'll sort some other time to visit you.
COUNTESS:
What means he now? Go ask him whither he
goes.
MESSENGER:
Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
TALBOT:
Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
I go to certify her Talbot's here.
COUNTESS:
If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.
TALBOT:
Prisoner! To whom?
COUNTESS:
To me, blood-thirsty lord
And for that cause I train'd thee to my house.
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
For in my gallery thy picture hangs;
But now the substance shall endure the like
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country, slain our citizens,
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
TALBOT:
Ha, ha, ha!
COUNTESS:
Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to
moan.
TALBOT:
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
Whereon to practise your severity.
COUNTESS:
Why, art not thou the man?
TALBOT:
I am indeed.
COUNTESS:
Then have I substance too.
TALBOT:
No, no, I am but shadow of myself.
You are deceiv'd, my substance is not here;
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity.
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't.
COUNTESS:
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
He will be here, and yet he is not here.
How can these contrarieties agree?
TALBOT:
That will I show you presently.
How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
And in a moment makes them desolate.
COUNTESS:
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse.
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art.
TALBOT:
Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconster
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
The outward composition of his body.
What you have done hath not offended me.
Nor other satisfaction do I crave
But only, with your patience, that we may
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
COUNTESS:
With all my heart, and think me honoured
To feast so great a warrior in my house.
PLANTAGENET:
Great lords and gentlemen, what means this
silence?
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
SUFFOLK:
Within the Temple Hall we were too loud;
The garden here is more convenient.
PLANTAGENET:
Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;
Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error?
SUFFOLK:
Faith, I have been a truant in the law
And never yet could frame my will to it;
And therefore frame the law unto my will.
SOMERSET:
Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
WARWICK:
Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
Between two blades, which bears the better temper;
Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
PLANTAGENET:
Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
The truth appears so naked on my side
That any purblind eye may find it out.
SOMERSET:
And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
So clear, so shining, and so evident,
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
PLANTAGENET:
Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.
Let him that is a true-born gentleman
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
SOMERSET:
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
But dare maintain the party of the truth,
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
WARWICK:
I love no colours; and, without all colour
Of base insinuating flattery,
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
SUFFOLK:
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
And say withal I think he held the right.
VERNON:
Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
SOMERSET:
Good Master Vernon, it is well objected;
If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
PLANTAGENET:
And I.
VERNON:
Then, for the truth and plainness of the case,
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
SOMERSET:
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,
And fall on my side so, against your will.
VERNON:
If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
And keep me on the side where still I am.
SOMERSET:
Well, well, come on; who else?
LAWYER:
[To Somerset]
false,
The argument you held was wrong in you;
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
PLANTAGENET:
Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
SOMERSET:
Here in my scabbard, meditating that
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
PLANTAGENET:
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
roses;
For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
The truth on our side.
SOMERSET:
No, Plantagenet,
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
PLANTAGENET:
Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
SOMERSET:
Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
PLANTAGENET:
Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
SOMERSET:
Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
That shall maintain what I have said is true,
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
PLANTAGENET:
Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
SUFFOLK:
Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
PLANTAGENET:
Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and
thee.
SUFFOLK:
I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
SOMERSET:
Away, away, good William de la Pole!
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
WARWICK:
Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
Third son to the third Edward, King of England.
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
PLANTAGENET:
He bears him on the place's privilege,
Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.
SOMERSET:
By Him that made me, I'll maintain my words
On any plot of ground in Christendom.
Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
For treason executed in our late king's days?
And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.
PLANTAGENET:
My father was attached, not attainted;
Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
Were growing time once ripened to my will.
For your partaker Pole, and you yourself,
I'll note you in my book of memory
To scourge you for this apprehension.
Look to it well, and say you are well warn'd.
SOMERSET:
Ay, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
And know us by these colours for thy foes
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
PLANTAGENET:
And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
Will I for ever, and my faction, wear,
Until it wither with me to my grave,
Or flourish to the height of my degree.
SUFFOLK:
Go forward, and be chok'd with thy ambition!
And so farewell until I meet thee next.
SOMERSET:
Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious
Richard.
PLANTAGENET:
How I am brav'd, and must perforce endure
it!
WARWICK:
This blot that they object against your house
Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament,
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
And if thou be not then created York,
I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
Will I upon thy party wear this rose;
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,
Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
PLANTAGENET:
Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you
That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
VERNON:
In your behalf still will I wear the same.
LAWYER:
And so will I.
PLANTAGENET:
Thanks, gentle sir.
Come, let us four to dinner. I dare say
This quarrel will drink blood another day.
MORTIMER:
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
Even like a man new haled from the rack,
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
Argue the end
SUFFOLK:
As by your high imperial Majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France,
As procurator to your Excellence,
To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;
So, in the famous ancient city Tours,
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alencon,
Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,
I have perform'd my task, and was espous'd;
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
In sight of England and her lordly peers,
Deliver up my title in the Queen
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent:
The happiest gift that ever marquis gave,
The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd.
KING HENRY:
Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
I can express no kinder sign of love
Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
QUEEN:
Great King of England, and my gracious lord,
The mutual conference that my mind hath had,
By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
In courtly company or at my beads,
With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,
Makes me the bolder to salute my king
With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
KING HENRY:
Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
Makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys,
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
ALL:
[Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
QUEEN:
We thank you all.
SUFFOLK:
My Lord Protector, so it please your Grace,
Here are the articles of contracted peace
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles,
For eighteen months concluded by consent.
GLOUCESTER:
[Reads] 'Imprimis: It is agreed between the French King
Charles and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador
for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the
Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia,
and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth
of May next ensuing.
released and delivered to the King her father'-
KING HENRY:
Uncle, how now!
GLOUCESTER:
Pardon me, gracious lord;
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart,
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
KING HENRY:
Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.
CARDINAL:
[Reads] 'Item: It is further agreed between them that the
duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over
to the King her father, and she sent over of the King of
England's own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'
KING HENRY:
They please us well. Lord Marquess, kneel down.
We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,
And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
We here discharge your Grace from being Regent
I' th' parts of France, till term of eighteen months
Be full expir'd. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
Salisbury, and Warwick;
We thank you all for this great favour done
In entertainment to my princely queen.
Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
To see her coronation be perform'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?
Did he so often lodge in open field,
In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
To conquer France, his true inheritance?
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
To keep by policy what Henry got?
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
With all the learned Council of the realm,
Studied so long, sat in the Council House
Early and late, debating to and fro
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe?
And had his Highness in his infancy
Crowned in Paris, in despite of foes?
And shall these labours and these honours die?
Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?
O peers of England, shameful is this league!
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
Blotting your names from books of memory,
Razing the characters of your renown,
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
Undoing all, as all had never been!
CARDINAL:
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
This peroration with such circumstance?
For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;
But now it is impossible we should.
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
SALISBURY:
Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
These counties were the keys of Normandy!
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
WARWICK:
For grief that they are past recovery;
For were there hope to conquer them again
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer;
And are the cities that I got with wounds
Deliver'd up again with peaceful words?
Mort Dieu!
YORK:
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
France should have torn and rent my very heart
Before I would have yielded to this league.
I never read but England's kings have had
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;
And our King Henry gives away his own
To match with her that brings no vantages.
GLOUCESTER:
A proper jest, and never heard before,
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
For costs and charges in transporting her!
She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France,
Before-
CARDINAL:
My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
GLOUCESTER:
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
I see thy fury; if I longer stay
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
CARDINAL:
So, there goes our Protector in a rage.
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood
And heir apparent to the English crown.
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.
Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
What though the common people favour him,
Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,'
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
He will be found a dangerous Protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why should he then protect our sovereign,
He being of age to govern of himself?
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
CARDINAL:
This weighty business will not brook delay;
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
SOMERSET:
Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal;
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside;
If Gloucester be displac'd, he'll be Protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,
Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.
SALISBURY:
Pride went before, ambition follows him.
While these do labour for their own preferment,
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal-
More like a soldier than a man o' th' church,
As stout and proud as he were lord of all-
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
Warwick my son, the comfort of my age,
Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy housekeeping,
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
In bringing them to civil discipline,
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France
When thou wert Regent for our sovereign,
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
Join we together for the public good,
In what we can, to bridle and suppress
The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal,
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
While they do tend the profit of the land.
WARWICK:
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land
And common profit of his country!
YORK:
And so says York- for he hath greatest cause.
SALISBURY:
Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.
WARWICK:
Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost-
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
And would have kept so long as breath did last.
Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
Which I will win from France, or else be slain.
YORK:
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.
Suffolk concluded on the articles;
The peers agreed; and Henry was well pleas'd
To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,
And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
While all is shar'd and all is borne away,
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own.
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland,
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts,
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit.
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve;
Watch thou and wake, when others be asleep,
To pry into the secrets of the state;
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars;
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd,
And in my standard bear the arms of York,
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown,
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
DUCHESS:
Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
As frowning at the favours of the world?
Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth,
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
What see'st thou there? King Henry's diadem,
Enchas'd with all the honours of the world?
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face
Until thy head be circled with the same.
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine;
And having both together heav'd it up,
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
And never more abase our sight so low
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
GLOUCESTER:
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts!
And may that thought, when I imagine ill
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.
DUCHESS:
What dream'd my lord? Tell me, and I'll requite it
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
GLOUCESTER:
Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
But, as I think, it was by th' Cardinal;
And on the pieces of the broken wand
Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
This was my dream; what it doth bode God knows.
DUCHESS:
Tut, this was nothing but an argument
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
Shall lose his head for his presumption.
But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet Duke:
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
In the cathedral church of Westminster,
And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd;
Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me,
And on my head did set the diadem.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright.
Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtur'd Eleanor!
Art thou not second woman in the realm,
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him?
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
To tumble down thy husband and thyself
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
Away from me, and let me hear no more!
DUCHESS:
What, what, my lord! Are you so choleric
With Eleanor for telling but her dream?
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself
And not be check'd.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, be not angry; I am pleas'd again.
MESSENGER:
My Lord Protector, 'tis his Highness' pleasure
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.
GLOUCESTER:
I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
DUCHESS:
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
Follow I must; I cannot go before,
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
Where are you there, Sir John? Nay, fear not, man,
We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
HUME:
Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!
DUCHESS:
What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace.
HUME:
But, by the grace of God and Hume's advice,
Your Grace's title shall be multiplied.
DUCHESS:
What say'st thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferr'd
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch of Eie,
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
And will they undertake to do me good?
HUME:
This they have promised, to show your Highness
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
That shall make answer to such questions
As by your Grace shall be propounded him
DUCHESS:
It is enough; I'll think upon the questions;
When from Saint Albans we do make return
We'll see these things effected to the full.
Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
HUME:
Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold;
Marry, and shall. But, how now, Sir John Hume!
Seal up your lips and give no words but mum:
The business asketh silent secrecy.
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil.
Yet have I gold flies from another coast-
I dare not say from the rich Cardinal,
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
Yet I do find it so; for, to be plain,
They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
Have hired me to undermine the Duchess,
And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker';
Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal's broker.
Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
Well, so its stands; and thus, I fear, at last
Hume's knavery will be the Duchess' wreck,
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall
Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.
FIRST PETITIONER:
My masters, let's stand close; my Lord Protector
will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our
supplications in the quill.
SECOND PETITIONER:
Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good
man, Jesu bless him!
FIRST PETITIONER:
Here 'a comes, methinks, and the Queen with him.
I'll be the first, sure.
SECOND PETITIONER:
Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk and
not my Lord Protector.
SUFFOLK:
How now, fellow! Wouldst anything with me?
FIRST PETITIONER:
I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my Lord
Protector.
QUEEN:
[Reads] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are your supplications to
his lordship? Let me see them. What is thine?
FIRST PETITIONER:
Mine is, an't please your Grace, against John
Goodman, my Lord Cardinal's man, for keeping my house and lands,
and wife and all, from me.
SUFFOLK:
Thy wife too! That's some wrong indeed. What's yours?
What's here! 'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing
the commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!
SECOND PETITIONER:
Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our
whole township.
PETER:
[Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner,
for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.
QUEEN:
What say'st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful
heir to the crown?
PETER:
That my master was? No, forsooth. My master said that he
was, and that the King was an usurper.
SUFFOLK:
Who is there? Take this fellow in, and
send for his master with a pursuivant presently. We'll hear more
of your matter before the King.
QUEEN:
And as for you, that love to be protected
Under the wings of our Protector's grace,
Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
ALL:
Come, let's be gone.
QUEEN:
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
Is this the fashions in the court of England?
Is this the government of Britain's isle,
And this the royalty of Albion's king?
What, shall King Henry be a pupil still,
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
Am I a queen in title and in style,
And must be made a subject to a duke?
I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
In courage, courtship, and proportion;
But all his mind is bent to holiness,
To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
His champions are the prophets and apostles;
His weapons, holy saws of sacred writ;
His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
Are brazen images of canonized saints.
I would the college of the Cardinals
Would choose him Pope, and carry him to Rome,
And set the triple crown upon his head;
That were a state fit for his holiness.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, be patient. As I was cause
Your Highness came to England, so will I
In England work your Grace's full content.
QUEEN:
Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort
The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham,
And grumbling York; and not the least of these
But can do more in England than the King.
SUFFOLK:
And he of these that can do most of all
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils;
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
QUEEN:
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife.
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife.
Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
And in her heart she scorns our poverty;
Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her?
Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t' other day
The very train of her worst wearing gown
Was better worth than all my father's lands,
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, myself have lim'd a bush for her,
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
That she will light to listen to the lays,
And never mount to trouble you again.
So, let her rest. And, madam, list to me,
For I am bold to counsel you in this:
Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
Will make but little for his benefit.
So one by one we'll weed them all at last,
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
KING HENRY:
For my part, noble lords, I care not which:
Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
YORK:
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
SOMERSET:
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
Let York be Regent; I will yield to him.
WARWICK:
Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,
Dispute not that; York is the worthier.
CARDINAL:
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
WARWICK:
The Cardinal's not my better in the field.
BUCKINGHAM:
All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
WARWICK:
Warwick may live to be the best of all.
SALISBURY:
Peace, son! And show some reason, Buckingham,
Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this.
QUEEN:
Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, the King is old enough himself
To give his censure. These are no women's matters.
QUEEN:
If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
To be Protector of his Excellence?
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, I am Protector of the realm;
And at his pleasure will resign my place.
SUFFOLK:
Resign it then, and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wert king- as who is king but thou?-
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas,
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
CARDINAL:
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
SOMERSET:
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.
BUCKINGHAM:
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
And left thee to the mercy of the law.
QUEEN:
Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
If they were known, as the suspect is great,
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
Give me my fan. What, minion, can ye not?
I cry your mercy, madam; was it you?
DUCHESS:
Was't I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
I could set my ten commandments in your face.
KING HENRY:
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
DUCHESS:
Against her will, good King? Look to 't in time;
She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby.
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd.
BUCKINGHAM:
Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.
She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
GLOUCESTER:
Now, lords, my choler being overblown
With walking once about the quadrangle,
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
As for your spiteful false objections,
Prove them, and I lie open to the law;
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
As I in duty love my king and country!
But to the matter that we have in hand:
I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
To be your Regent in the realm of France.
SUFFOLK:
Before we make election, give me leave
To show some reason, of no little force,
That York is most unmeet of any man.
YORK:
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands.
Last time I danc'd attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieg'd, famish'd, and lost.
WARWICK:
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit.
SUFFOLK:
Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK:
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
SUFFOLK:
Because here is a man accus'd of treason:
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
YORK:
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING HENRY:
What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK:
Please it your Majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason;
His words were these: that Richard Duke of York
Was rightful heir unto the English crown,
And that your Majesty was an usurper.
KING HENRY:
Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER:
An't shall please your Majesty, I never said nor thought
any such matter. God is my witness, I am falsely accus'd by the
villain.
PETER:
[Holding up his hands] By these ten bones, my lords, he did
speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
Lord of York's armour.
YORK:
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
I do beseech your royal Majesty,
Let him have all the rigour of the law.
accuser is my prentice; and when I did correct him for his fault
the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with
me. I have good witness of this; therefore I beseech your
Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
accusation.
KING HENRY:
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOUCESTER:
This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
Let Somerset be Regent o'er the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion;
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place,
For he hath witness of his servant's malice.
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
SOMERSET:
I humbly thank your royal Majesty.
HORNER:
And I accept the combat willingly.
PETER:
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case!
The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon
me, I shall never be able to fight a blow! O Lord, my heart!
GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.
KING HENRY:
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat shall
be the last of the next month.
Come, Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
HUME:
Come, my masters; the Duchess, I tell you, expects
performance of your promises.
BOLINGBROKE:
Master Hume, we are therefore provided; will her
ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
HUME:
Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.
BOLINGBROKE:
I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
invincible spirit; but it shall be convenient, Master Hume, that
you be by her aloft while we be busy below; and so I pray you go,
in God's name, and leave us. Mother Jourdain, be you
prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell, read you; and
let us to our work.
DUCHESS:
Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this gear, the
sooner the better.
BOLINGBROKE:
Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves-
That time best fits the work we have in hand.
Madam, sit you, and fear not: whom we raise
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
SPIRIT:
Adsum.
MARGERY JOURDAIN:
Asmath,
By the eternal God, whose name and power
Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence.
SPIRIT:
Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
BOLINGBROKE:
[Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
SPIRIT:
The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive, and die a violent death.
BOLINGBROKE:
'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
SPIRIT:
By water shall he die and take his end.
BOLINGBROKE:
'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
SPIRIT:
Let him shun castles:
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.
Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
BOLINGBROKE:
Descend to darkness and the burning lake;
False fiend, avoid!
YORK:
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
What, madam, are you there? The King and commonweal
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains;
My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
DUCHESS:
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
Injurious Duke, that threatest where's no cause.
BUCKINGHAM:
True, madam, none at all. What can you this?
Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close,
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
Stafford, take her to thee.
We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
All, away!
YORK:
Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch'd her well.
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
What have we here?
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
Why, this is just
'Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
Well, to the rest:
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'By water shall he die and take his end.'
'What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?'
'Let him shun castles;
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.'
Come, come, my lords;
These oracles are hardly attain'd,
And hardly understood.
The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans,
With him the husband of this lovely lady;
Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them-
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
BUCKINGHAM:
Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
To be the post, in hope of his reward.
YORK:
At your pleasure, my good lord.
Who's within there, ho?
Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
QUEEN:
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
I saw not better sport these seven years' day;
Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high,
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out.
KING HENRY:
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
To see how God in all His creatures works!
Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
SUFFOLK:
No marvel, an it like your Majesty,
My Lord Protector's hawks do tow'r so well;
They know their master loves to be aloft,
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
GLOUCESTER:
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
CARDINAL:
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, my lord Cardinal, how think you by that?
Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?
KING HENRY:
The treasury of everlasting joy!
CARDINAL:
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;
Pernicious Protector, dangerous peer,
That smooth'st it so with King and commonweal.
GLOUCESTER:
What, Cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice;
With such holiness can you do it?
SUFFOLK:
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
GLOUCESTER:
As who, my lord?
SUFFOLK:
Why, as you, my lord,
An't like your lordly Lord's Protectorship.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN:
And thy ambition, Gloucester.
KING HENRY:
I prithee, peace,
Good Queen, and whet not on these furious peers;
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
CARDINAL:
Let me be blessed for the peace I make
Against this proud Protector with my sword!
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would 'twere
come to that!
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Marry, when thou dar'st.
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious numbers for the
In thine own person answer thy abuse.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Ay, where thou dar'st not peep; an
This evening on the east side of the grove.
KING HENRY:
How now, my lords!
CARDINAL:
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
We had had more sport. Come with thy
GLOUCESTER:
True, uncle.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advis'd? The east side of
the grove?
GLOUCESTER:
[Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.
KING HENRY:
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
GLOUCESTER:
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
I'll shave your crown for this,
Or all my fence shall fail.
CARDINAL:
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum;
Protector, see to't well; protect yourself.
KING HENRY:
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
GLOUCESTER:
What means this noise?
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
TOWNSMAN:
A miracle! A miracle!
SUFFOLK:
Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.
TOWNSMAN:
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Albans shrine
Within this half hour hath receiv'd his sight;
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
KING HENRY:
Now God be prais'd that to believing souls
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
CARDINAL:
Here comes the townsmen on procession
To present your Highness with the man.
KING HENRY:
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
GLOUCESTER:
Stand by, my masters; bring him near the King;
His Highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
KING HENRY:
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
What, hast thou been long blind and now restor'd?
SIMPCOX:
Born blind, an't please your Grace.
WIFE:
Ay indeed was he.
SUFFOLK:
What woman is this?
WIFE:
His wife, an't like your worship.
GLOUCESTER:
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better
told.
KING HENRY:
Where wert thou born?
SIMPCOX:
At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace.
KING HENRY:
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee.
Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done.
QUEEN:
Tell me, good fellow, cam'st thou here by chance,
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
SIMPCOX:
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
By good Saint Alban, who said 'Simpcox, come,
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
WIFE:
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
CARDINAL:
What, art thou lame?
SIMPCOX:
Ay, God Almighty help me!
SUFFOLK:
How cam'st thou so?
SIMPCOX:
A fall off of a tree.
WIFE:
A plum tree, master.
GLOUCESTER:
How long hast thou been blind?
SIMPCOX:
O, born so, master!
GLOUCESTER:
What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX:
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
WIFE:
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
GLOUCESTER:
Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
SIMPCOX:
Alas, good master, my wife desir'd some damsons
And made me climb, With danger of my life.
GLOUCESTER:
A subtle knave! But yet it shall not serve:
Let me see thine eyes; wink now; now open them;
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
SIMPCOX:
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
GLOUCESTER:
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
SIMPCOX:
Red, master; red as blood.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
SIMPCOX:
Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
KING HENRY:
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
SUFFOLK:
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
GLOUCESTER:
But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.
WIFE:
Never before this day in all his life.
GLOUCESTER:
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, I know not.
GLOUCESTER:
What's his name?
SIMPCOX:
I know not.
GLOUCESTER:
Nor his?
SIMPCOX:
No, indeed, master.
GLOUCESTER:
What's thine own name?
SIMPCOX:
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
GLOUCESTER:
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lying'st knave in
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well
have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we
do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours; but suddenly to
nominate them all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his cunning to be
great that could restore this cripple to his legs again?
SIMPCOX:
O master, that you could!
GLOUCESTER:
My masters of Saint Albans, have you not beadles in
your town, and things call'd whips?
MAYOR:
Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Then send for one presently.
MAYOR:
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
GLOUCESTER:
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. [A stool
brought] Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping,
leap me over this stool and run away.
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone!
You go about to torture me in vain.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.
Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
BEADLE:
I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet
quickly.
SIMPCOX:
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
KING HENRY:
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
QUEEN:
It made me laugh to see the villain run.
GLOUCESTER:
Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
WIFE:
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
GLOUCESTER:
Let them be whipp'd through every market town till they
come to Berwick, from whence they came.
CARDINAL:
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
SUFFOLK:
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
GLOUCESTER:
But you have done more miracles than I:
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.
KING HENRY:
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
Under the countenance and confederacy
Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector's wife,
The ringleader and head of all this rout,
Have practis'd dangerously against your state,
Dealing with witches and with conjurers,
Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
Demanding of King Henry's life and death
And other of your Highness' Privy Council,
As more at large your Grace shall understand.
CARDINAL:
And so, my Lord Protector, by this means
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
GLOUCESTER:
Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.
Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the
Or to the meanest groom.
KING HENRY:
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
QUEEN:
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest;
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
GLOUCESTER:
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal
How I have lov'd my King and commonweal;
And for my wife I know not how it stands.
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard.
Noble she is; but if she have forgot
Honour and virtue, and convers'd with such
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
I banish her my bed and company
And give her as a prey to law and shame,
That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name.
KING HENRY:
Well, for this night we will repose us here.
To-morrow toward London back again
To look into this business thoroughly
And call these foul offenders to their answers,
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.
YORK:
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
Our simple supper ended, give me leave
In this close walk to satisfy myself
In craving your opinion of my tide,
Which is infallible, to England's crown.
SALISBURY:
My lord, I long to hear it at full.
WARWICK:
Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
YORK:
Then thus:
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons;
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
And left behind him Richard, his only son,
Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king
Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came.
And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,
Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.
WARWICK:
Father, the Duke hath told the truth;
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
YORK:
Which now they hold by force, and not by right;
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
SALISBURY:
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
YORK:
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
I claim the crown, had issue Philippe, a daughter,
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;
Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.
SALISBURY:
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
Who kept him in captivity till he died.
But, to the rest.
YORK:
His eldest sister, Anne,
My mother, being heir unto the crown,
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son.
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;
So, if the issue of the elder son
Succeed before the younger, I am King.
WARWICK:
What plain proceedings is more plain than this?
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
The fourth son: York claims it from the third.
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign.
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
And in this private plot be we the first
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
With honour of his birthright to the crown.
BOTH:
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!
YORK:
We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
But with advice and silent secrecy.
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,
Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
SALISBURY:
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
WARWICK:
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
YORK:
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
The greatest man in England but the King.
KING HENRY:
Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.
You four, from hence to prison back again;
From thence unto the place of execution:
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
Despoiled of your honour in your life,
Shall, after three days' open penance done,
Live in your country here in banishment
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.
DUCHESS:
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
GLOUCESTER:
Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee.
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go;
Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.
KING HENRY:
Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester; ere thou go,
Give up thy staff; Henry will to himself
Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet.
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less belov'd
Than when thou wert Protector to thy King.
QUEEN:
I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child.
God and King Henry govern England's realm!
Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.
GLOUCESTER:
My staff! Here, noble Henry, is my staff.
As willingly do I the same resign
As ere thy father Henry made it mine;
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it.
Farewell, good King; when I am dead and gone,
May honourable peace attend thy throne!
QUEEN:
Why, now is Henry King, and Margaret Queen,
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
That bears so shrewd a maim: two pulls at once-
His lady banish'd and a limb lopp'd off.
This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
SUFFOLK:
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
YORK:
Lords, let him go. Please it your Majesty,
This is the day appointed for the combat;
And ready are the appellant and defendant,
The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,
So please your Highness to behold the fight.
QUEEN:
Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
KING HENRY:
A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;
Here let them end it, and God defend the right!
YORK:
I never saw a fellow worse bested,
Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
The servant of his armourer, my lords.
FIRST NEIGHBOUR:
Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of
sack; and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
SECOND NEIGHBOUR:
And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
THIRD NEIGHBOUR:
And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour;
drink, and fear not your man.
HORNER:
Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and a fig
for Peter!
FIRST PRENTICE:
Here, Peter, I drink to thee; and be not afraid.
SECOND PRENTICE:
Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight
for credit of the prentices.
PETER:
I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you; for I
think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, an
if I die, I give thee my apron; and, Will, thou shalt have my
hammer; and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O Lord
bless me, I pray God! for I am never able to deal with my master,
he hath learnt so much fence already.
SALISBURY:
Come, leave your drinking and fall to blows.
Sirrah, what's thy name?
PETER:
Peter, forsooth.
SALISBURY:
Peter? What more?
PETER:
Thump.
SALISBURY:
Thump? Then see thou thump thy master well.
HORNER:
Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and
touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him
any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have
at thee with a down right blow!
YORK:
Dispatch- this knave's tongue begins to double.
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
HORNER:
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
YORK:
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in
thy master's way.
PETER:
O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O
Peter, thou hast prevail'd in right!
KING HENRY:
Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
For by his death we do perceive his guilt;
And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
GLOUCESTER:
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,
And after summer evermore succeeds
Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold;
So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
Sirs, what's o'clock?
GLOUCESTER:
Ten is the hour that was appointed me
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess.
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
The abject people gazing on thy face,
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
But, soft! I think she comes, and I'll prepare
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
GLOUCESTER:
No, stir not for your lives; let her pass by.
DUCHESS:
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
See how the giddy multitude do point
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee;
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
DUCHESS:
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
And thou a prince, Protector of this land,
Methinks I should not thus be led along,
Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
And when I start, the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread.
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife,
And he a prince, and ruler of the land;
Yet so he rul'd, and such a prince he was,
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
To every idle rascal follower.
But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
Hang over thee, as sure it shortly will.
For Suffolk- he that can do all in all
With her that hateth thee and hates us all-
And York, and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings,
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee.
But fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd,
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, Nell, forbear! Thou aimest all awry.
I must offend before I be attainted;
And had I twenty times so many foes,
And each of them had twenty times their power,
All these could not procure me any scathe
So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
Why, yet thy scandal were not wip'd away,
But I in danger for the breach of law.
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell.
I pray thee sort thy heart to patience;
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
HERALD:
I summon your Grace to his Majesty's Parliament,
Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
GLOUCESTER:
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
My Nell, I take my leave- and, master sheriff,
Let not her penance exceed the King's commission.
SHERIFF:
An't please your Grace, here my commission stays;
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
GLOUCESTER:
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
STANLEY:
So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
You use her well; the world may laugh again,
And I may live to do you kindness if
You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell.
DUCHESS:
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
GLOUCESTER:
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
DUCHESS:
Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee!
For none abides with me. My joy is death-
Death, at whose name I oft have been afeard,
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
Stanley, I prithee go, and take me hence;
I care not whither, for I beg no favour,
Only convey me where thou art commanded.
STANLEY:
Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
There to be us'd according to your state.
DUCHESS:
That's bad enough, for I am but reproach-
And shall I then be us'd reproachfully?
STANLEY:
Like to a duchess and Duke Humphrey's lady;
According to that state you shall be us'd.
DUCHESS:
Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
SHERIFF:
It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
DUCHESS:
Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharg'd.
Come, Stanley, shall we go?
STANLEY:
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
And go we to attire you for our journey.
DUCHESS:
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.
No, it will hang upon my richest robes
And show itself, attire me how I can.
Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.
KING HENRY:
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come.
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
QUEEN:
Can you not see, or will ye not observe
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
With what a majesty he bears himself;
How insolent of late he is become,
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
We know the time since he was mild and affable,
And if we did but glance a far-off look
Immediately he was upon his knee,
That all the court admir'd him for submission.
But meet him now and be it in the morn,
When every one will give the time of day,
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
But great men tremble when the lion roars,
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
First note that he is near you in descent,
And should you fall he is the next will mount;
Me seemeth, then, it is no policy-
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears,
And his advantage following your decease-
That he should come about your royal person
Or be admitted to your Highness' Council.
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts;
And when he please to make commotion,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.
If it be fond, can it a woman's fear;
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
I will subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke.
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
Reprove my allegation if you can,
Or else conclude my words effectual.
SUFFOLK:
Well hath your Highness seen into this duke;
And had I first been put to speak my mind,
I think I should have told your Grace's tale.
The Duchess, by his subornation,
Upon my life, began her devilish practices;
Or if he were not privy to those faults,
Yet by reputing of his high descent-
As next the King he was successive heir-
And such high vaunts of his nobility,
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man
Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.
CARDINAL:
Did he not, contrary to form of law,
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
YORK:
And did he not, in his protectorship,
Levy great sums of money through the realm
For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown
Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.
KING HENRY:
My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
Is worthy praise; but shall I speak my conscience?
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
From meaning treason to our royal person
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
QUEEN:
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance?
Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrow'd,
For he's disposed as the hateful raven.
Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf.
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
SOMERSET:
All health unto my gracious sovereign!
KING HENRY:
Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
SOMERSET:
That all your interest in those territories
Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
KING HENRY:
Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done!
YORK:
[Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
But I will remedy this gear ere long,
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
GLOUCESTER:
All happiness unto my lord the King!
Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
SUFFOLK:
Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.
I do arrest thee of high treason here.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
The purest spring is not so free from mud
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.
Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?
YORK:
'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;
By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.
GLOUCESTER:
Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night-
Ay, night by night- in studying good for England!
That doit that e'er I wrested from the King,
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
Be brought against me at my trial-day!
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,
Because I would not tax the needy commons,
Have I dispursed to the garrisons,
And never ask'd for restitution.
CARDINAL:
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
GLOUCESTER:
I say no more than truth, so help me God!
YORK:
In your protectorship you did devise
Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,
That England was defam'd by tyranny.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector
Pity was all the fault that was in me;
For I should melt at an offender's tears,
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
Unless it were a bloody murderer,
Or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers,
I never gave them condign punishment.
Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortur'd
Above the felon or what trespass else.
SUFFOLK:
My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer'd;
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
I do arrest you in His Highness' name,
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
To keep until your further time of trial.
KING HENRY:
My Lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
That you will clear yourself from all suspense.
My conscience tells me you are innocent.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous!
Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition,
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;
Foul subornation is predominant,
And equity exil'd your Highness' land.
I know their complot is to have my life;
And if my death might make this island happy
And prove the period of their tyranny,
I would expend it with all willingness.
But mine is made the prologue to their play;
For thousands more that yet suspect no peril
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart;
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
By false accuse doth level at my life.
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
My liefest liege to be mine enemy;
Ay, all of you have laid your heads together-
Myself had notice of your conventicles-
And all to make away my guiltless life.
I shall not want false witness to condemn me
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.
The ancient proverb will be well effected:
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
CARDINAL:
My liege, his railing is intolerable.
If those that care to keep your royal person
From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage
Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,
And the offender granted scope of speech,
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
SUFFOLK:
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
As if she had suborned some to swear
False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
QUEEN:
But I can give the loser leave to chide.
GLOUCESTER:
Far truer spoke than meant: I lose indeed.
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!
And well such losers may have leave to speak.
BUCKINGHAM:
He'll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day.
Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.
CARDINAL:
Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.
GLOUCESTER:
Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Before his legs be firm to bear his body!
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
KING HENRY:
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
QUEEN:
What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?
KING HENRY:
Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;
My body round engirt with misery-
For what's more miserable than discontent?
Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
The map of honour, truth, and loyalty!
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith.
What louring star now envies thy estate
That these great lords, and Margaret our Queen,
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
And as the butcher takes away the calf,
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
Even so, remorseless, have they borne him hence;
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
Looking the way her harmless young one went,
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
Look after him, and cannot do him good,
So mighty are his vowed enemies.
His fortunes I will weep, and 'twixt each groan
Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
QUEEN:
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams:
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester's show
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers;
Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank,
With shining checker'd slough, doth sting a child
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I-
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good-
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
To rid us from the fear we have of him.
CARDINAL:
That he should die is worthy policy;
But yet we want a colour for his death.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
SUFFOLK:
But, in my mind, that were no policy:
The King will labour still to save his life;
The commons haply rise to save his life;
And yet we have but trivial argument,
More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
YORK:
So that, by this, you would not have him die.
SUFFOLK:
Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
YORK:
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:
Were't not all one an empty eagle were set
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector?
QUEEN:
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
SUFFOLK:
Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
Who being accus'd a crafty murderer,
His guilt should be but idly posted over,
Because his purpose is not executed.
No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock,
Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
As Humphrey, prov'd by reasons, to my liege.
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him;
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
So he be dead; for that is good deceit
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
QUEEN:
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
SUFFOLK:
Not resolute, except so much were done,
For things are often spoke and seldom meant;
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
Seeing the deed is meritorious,
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
CARDINAL:
But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
Ere you can take due orders for a priest;
Say you consent and censure well the deed,
And I'll provide his executioner-
I tender so the safety of my liege.
SUFFOLK:
Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing.
QUEEN:
And so say I.
YORK:
And I. And now we three have spoke it,
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
POST:
Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain
To signify that rebels there are up
And put the Englishmen unto the sword.
Send succours, lords, and stop the rage betime,
Before the wound do grow uncurable;
For, being green, there is great hope of help.
CARDINAL:
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
YORK:
That Somerset be sent as Regent thither;
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
SOMERSET:
If York, with all his far-fet policy,
Had been the Regent there instead of me,
He never would have stay'd in France so long.
YORK:
No, not to lose it all as thou hast done.
I rather would have lost my life betimes
Than bring a burden of dishonour home
By staying there so long till all were lost.
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win.
QUEEN:
Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with;
No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still.
Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been Regent there,
Might happily have prov'd far worse than his.
YORK:
What, worse than nought? Nay, then a shame take all!
SOMERSET:
And in the number, thee that wishest shame!
CARDINAL:
My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen;
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
Collected choicely, from each county some,
And try your hap against the Irishmen?
YORK:
I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.
SUFFOLK:
Why, our authority is his consent,
And what we do establish he confirms;
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.
YORK:
I am content; provide me soldiers, lords,
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
SUFFOLK:
A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
CARDINAL:
No more of him; for I will deal with him
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
And so break off; the day is almost spent.
Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.
YORK:
My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
SUFFOLK:
I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
YORK:
Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts
And change misdoubt to resolution;
Be that thou hop'st to be; or what thou art
Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying.
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
Faster than spring-time show'rs comes thought on thought,
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
My brain, more busy than the labouring spider,
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done
To send me packing with an host of men.
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
I take it kindly. Yet be well assur'd
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
I will stir up in England some black storm
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head,
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
And for a minister of my intent
I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman,
John Cade of Ashford,
To make commotion, as full well he can,
Under the tide of John Mortimer.
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;
And in the end
WARWICK:
I wonder how the King escap'd our hands.
YORK:
While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,
He slily stole away and left his men;
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,
Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
Charg'd our main battle's front, and, breaking in,
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded dangerous;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd.
RICHARD:
Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.
YORK:
Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.
But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful King,
And this the regal seat. Possess it, York;
For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'.
YORK:
Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
For hither we have broken in by force.
NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
WARWICK:
And when the King comes, offer him no violence.
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
YORK:
The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of her council.
By words or blows here let us win our right.
RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
WARWICK:
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be King,
And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
YORK:
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:
I mean to take possession of my right.
WARWICK:
Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
KING HENRY:
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father;
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
CLIFFORD:
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
WESTMORELAND:
What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
KING HENRY:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons such as he;
He durst not sit there had your father liv'd.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
KING HENRY:
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
EXETER:
But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
KING HENRY:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats,
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.
YORK:
I am thine.
EXETER:
For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
YORK:
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
EXETER:
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.
CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
KING HENRY:
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
YORK:
It must and shall be so; content thyself.
WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
WESTMORELAND:
He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
WARWICK:
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chas'd you from the field,
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,
Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
CLIFFORD:
Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
WARWICK:
Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
YORK:
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
KING HENRY:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,
And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.
WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
KING HENRY:
The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd, I was but nine months old.
RICHARD:
You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
EDWARD:
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
MONTAGUE:
Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
YORK:
Sons, peace!
KING HENRY:
Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
WARWICK:
Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live.
KING HENRY:
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.
WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
KING HENRY:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
KING HENRY:
[Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
YORK:
What then?
KING HENRY:
An if he may, then am I lawful King;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
YORK:
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
KING HENRY:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
KING HENRY:
[Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd.
WARWICK:
Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the Duke up in despite of me.
CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence.
May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
KING HENRY:
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke of York;
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.
KING HENRY:
My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
YORK:
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st.
KING HENRY:
I am content. Richard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
CLIFFORD:
What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
WARWICK:
What good is this to England and himself!
WESTMORELAND:
Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
CLIFFORD:
How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
WESTMORELAND:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nor I.
CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be thou a prey unto the house of York
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
CLIFFORD:
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd!
WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
EXETER:
They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
KING HENRY:
Ah, Exeter!
WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?
KING HENRY:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may. I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
YORK:
This oath I willingly take, and will perform.
WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
KING HENRY:
And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
EXETER:
Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!
YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
MONTAGUE:
And I unto the sea, from whence I came.
KING HENRY:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
EXETER:
Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
I'll steal away.
KING HENRY:
Exeter, so will I.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
KING HENRY:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man! Would I had died a maid,
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father!
Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,
And disinherited thine only son.
PRINCE OF WALES:
Father, you cannot disinherit me.
If you be King, why should not I succeed?
KING HENRY:
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me;
And giv'n unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The Duke is made Protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou prefer'st thy life before thine honour;
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
KING HENRY:
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
KING HENRY:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
PRINCE OF WALES:
When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your Grace; till then I'll follow her.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
KING HENRY:
Poor queen! How love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Reveng'd may she be on that hateful Duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart.
I'll write unto them, and entreat them fair;
Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.
EXETER:
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
RICHARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.
MONTAGUE:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
YORK:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
What is your quarrel? How began it first?
EDWARD:
No quarrel, but a slight contention.
YORK:
About what?
RICHARD:
About that which concerns your Grace and us-
The crown of England, father, which is yours.
YORK:
Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or death.
EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end
BUCKINGHAM:
Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
Since last we saw in France?
NORFOLK:
I thank your Grace,
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
Of what I saw there.
BUCKINGHAM:
An untimely ague
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Met in the vale of Andren.
NORFOLK:
'Twixt Guynes and Arde-
I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
In their embracement, as they grew together;
Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd
Such a compounded one?
BUCKINGHAM:
All the whole time
I was my chamber's prisoner.
NORFOLK:
Then you lost
The view of earthly glory; men might say,
Till this time pomp was single, but now married
To one above itself. Each following day
Became the next day's master, till the last
Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
Shone down the English; and to-morrow they
Made Britain India: every man that stood
Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
As cherubins, an gilt; the madams too,
Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear
The pride upon them, that their very labour
Was to them as a painting. Now this masque
Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
As presence did present them: him in eye
still him in praise; and being present both,
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-
For so they phrase 'em-by their heralds challeng'd
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,
Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
That Bevis was believ'd.
BUCKINGHAM:
O, you go far!
NORFOLK:
As I belong to worship, and affect
In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything
Would by a good discourser lose some life
Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal:
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;
Order gave each thing view. The office did
Distinctly his full function.
BUCKINGHAM:
Who did guide-
I mean, who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together, as you guess?
NORFOLK:
One, certes, that promises no element
In such a business.
BUCKINGHAM:
I pray you, who, my lord?
NORFOLK:
All this was ord'red by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
BUCKINGHAM:
The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed
From his ambitious finger. What had he
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun,
And keep it from the earth.
NORFOLK:
Surely, sir,
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied
To eminent assistants, but spider-like,
Out of his self-drawing web, 'a gives us note
The force of his own merit makes his way-
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
A place next to the King.
ABERGAVENNY:
I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?
If not from hell, the devil is a niggard
Or has given all before, and he begins
A new hell in himself.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why the devil,
Upon this French going out, took he upon him-
Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Of all the gentry; for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,
The honourable board of council out,
Must fetch him in he papers.
ABERGAVENNY:
I do know
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
By this so sicken'd their estates that never
They shall abound as formerly.
BUCKINGHAM:
O, many
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
For this great journey. What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue?
NORFOLK:
Grievingly I think
The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it.
BUCKINGHAM:
Every man,
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
Into a general prophecy-that this tempest,
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
The sudden breach on't.
NORFOLK:
Which is budded out;
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
Our merchants' goods at Bordeaux.
ABERGAVENNY:
Is it therefore
Th' ambassador is silenc'd?
NORFOLK:
Marry, is't.
ABERGAVENNY:
A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd
At a superfluous rate!
BUCKINGHAM:
Why, all this business
Our reverend Cardinal carried.
NORFOLK:
Like it your Grace,
The state takes notice of the private difference
Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safety-that you read
The Cardinal's malice and his potency
Together; to consider further, that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
That he's revengeful; and I know his sword
Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said
It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel
You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
That I advise your shunning.
WOLSEY:
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha!
Where's his examination?
SECRETARY:
Here, so please you.
WOLSEY:
Is he in person ready?
SECRETARY:
Ay, please your Grace.
WOLSEY:
Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
shall lessen this big look.
BUCKINGHAM:
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
Outworths a noble's blood.
NORFOLK:
What, are you chaf'd?
Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only
Which your disease requires.
BUCKINGHAM:
I read in's looks
Matter against me, and his eye revil'd
Me as his abject object. At this instant
He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King;
I'll follow, and outstare him.
NORFOLK:
Stay, my lord,
And let your reason with your choler question
What 'tis you go about. To climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Can advise me like you; be to yourself
As you would to your friend.
BUCKINGHAM:
I'll to the King,
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
There's difference in no persons.
NORFOLK:
Be advis'd:
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself. We may outrun
By violent swiftness that which we run at,
And lose by over-running. Know you not
The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er
In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd.
I say again there is no English soul
More stronger to direct you than yourself,
If with the sap of reason you would quench
Or but allay the fire of passion.
BUCKINGHAM:
Sir,
I am thankful to you, and I'll go along
By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow-
Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but
From sincere motions, by intelligence,
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
We see each grain of gravel-I do know
To be corrupt and treasonous.
NORFOLK:
Say not treasonous.
BUCKINGHAM:
To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,
Or wolf, or both-for he is equal rav'nous
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
As able to perform't, his mind and place
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home, suggests the King our master
To this last costly treaty, th' interview
That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
Did break i' th' wrenching.
NORFOLK:
Faith, and so it did.
BUCKINGHAM:
Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal
The articles o' th' combination drew
As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified
As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end
As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal
Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,
Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt-
For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
To whisper Wolsey-here makes visitation-
His fears were that the interview betwixt
England and France might through their amity
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
Peep'd harms that menac'd him-privily
Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow-
Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor
Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made,
And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,
That he would please to alter the King's course,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,
As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
And for his own advantage.
NORFOLK:
I am sorry
To hear this of him, and could wish he were
Something mistaken in't.
BUCKINGHAM:
No, not a syllable:
I do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof.
BRANDON:
Your office, sergeant: execute it.
SERGEANT:
Sir,
My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
Of our most sovereign King.
BUCKINGHAM:
Lo you, my lord,
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
Under device and practice.
BRANDON:
I am sorry
To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure
You shall to th' Tower.
BUCKINGHAM:
It will help nothing
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heav'n
Be done in this and all things! I obey.
O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you well!
BRANDON:
Nay, he must bear you company.
Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know
How he determines further.
ABERGAVENNY:
As the Duke said,
The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure
By me obey'd.
BRANDON:
Here is warrant from
The King t' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies
Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car,
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor-
BUCKINGHAM:
So, so!
These are the limbs o' th' plot; no more, I hope.
BRANDON:
A monk o' th' Chartreux.
BUCKINGHAM:
O, Nicholas Hopkins?
BRANDON:
He.
BUCKINGHAM:
My surveyor is false. The o'er-great Cardinal
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already.
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
Exeunt
KING:
My life itself, and the best heart of it,
Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level
Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks
To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us
That gentleman of Buckingham's. In person
I'll hear his confessions justify;
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
Nay, we must longer kneel: I am suitor.
KING:
Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit
Never name to us: you have half our power.
The other moiety ere you ask is given;
Repeat your will, and take it.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
Thank your Majesty.
That you would love yourself, and in that love
Not unconsidered leave your honour nor
The dignity of your office, is the point
Of my petition.
KING:
Lady mine, proceed.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
I am solicited, not by a few,
And those of true condition, that your subjects
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart
Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,
My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
Most bitterly on you as putter-on
Of these exactions, yet the King our master-
Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not
Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
In loud rebellion.
NORFOLK:
Not almost appears-
It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
The clothiers all, not able to maintain
The many to them 'longing, have put of
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who
Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
And lack of other means, in desperate manner
Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar,
And danger serves among them.
KING:
Taxation!
Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,
You that are blam'd for it alike with us,
Know you of this taxation?
WOLSEY:
Please you, sir,
I know but of a single part in aught
Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
No, my lord!
You know no more than others! But you frame
Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them, and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em
The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say
They are devis'd by you, or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.
KING:
Still exaction!
The nature of it? In what kind, let's know,
Is this exaction?
QUEEN KATHARINE:
I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned
Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief
Comes through commissions, which compels from each
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Without delay; and the pretence for this
Is nam'd your wars in France. This makes bold mouths;
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them; their curses now
Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your Highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer business.
KING:
By my life,
This is against our pleasure.
WOLSEY:
And for me,
I have no further gone in this than by
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
Traduc'd by ignorant tongues, which neither know
My faculties nor person, yet will be
The chronicles of my doing, let me say
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
That virtue must go through. We must not stint
Our necessary actions in the fear
To cope malicious censurers, which ever
As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow
That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft
Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
For our best act. If we shall stand still,
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
We should take root here where we sit, or sit
State-statues only.
KING:
Things done well
And with a care exempt themselves from fear:
Things done without example, in their issue
Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent
Of this commission? I believe, not any.
We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
A trembling contribution! Why, we take
From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber;
And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
The air will drink the sap. To every county
Where this is question'd send our letters with
Free pardon to each man that has denied
The force of this commission. Pray, look tot;
I put it to your care.
WOLSEY:
[Aside to the SECRETARY]
Let there be letters writ to every shire
Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure.
KING:
It grieves many.
The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;
To nature none more bound; his training such
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
When these so noble benefits shall prove
Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,
They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find
His hour of speech a minute-he, my lady,
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
That once were his, and is become as black
As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear-
This was his gentleman in trust-of him
Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
The fore-recited practices, whereof
We cannot feel too little, hear too much.
WOLSEY:
Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
Most like a careful subject, have collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
KING:
Speak freely.
SURVEYOR:
First, it was usual with him-every day
It would infect his speech-that if the King
Should without issue die, he'll carry it so
To make the sceptre his. These very words
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
Lord Aberga'ny, to whom by oath he menac'd
Revenge upon the Cardinal.
WOLSEY:
Please your Highness, note
This dangerous conception in this point:
Not friended by his wish, to your high person
His will is most malignant, and it stretches
Beyond you to your friends.
QUEEN KATHARINE:
My learn'd Lord Cardinal,
Deliver all with charity.
KING:
Speak on.
How grounded he his title to the crown
Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him
At any time speak aught?
SURVEYOR:
He was brought to this
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.
KING:
What was that Henton?
SURVEYOR:
Sir, a Chartreux friar,
His confessor, who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty.
KING:
How know'st thou this?
SURVEYOR:
Not long before your Highness sped to France,
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey. I replied
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
To the King's danger. Presently the Duke
Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he
'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment;
Whom after under the confession's seal
He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living but
To me should utter, with demure confidence
This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs,
Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive
To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke
Shall govern England."'
QUEEN KATHARINE:
If I know you well,
You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office
On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;
Yes, heartily beseech you.
KING:
Let him on.
Go forward.
SURVEYOR:
On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions
The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous
To ruminate on this so far, until
It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,
It was much like to do. He answer'd 'Tush,
It can do me no damage'; adding further
That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd,
The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
Should have gone off.
KING:
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?
SURVEYOR:
I can, my liege.
KING:
Proceed.
SURVEYOR:
Being at Greenwich,
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke
About Sir William Bulmer-
KING:
I remember
Of such a time: being my sworn servant,
The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence?
SURVEYOR:
'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-
As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd
The part my father meant to act upon
Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted,
As he made semblance of his duty, would
Have put his knife into him.'
KING:
A giant traitor!
WOLSEY:
Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
And this man out of prison?
QUEEN KATHARINE:
God mend all!
KING:
There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?
SURVEYOR:
After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenour
Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose.
KING:
There's his period,
To sheath his knife in us. He is attach'd;
Call him to present trial. If he may
Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none,
Let him not seek't of us. By day and night!
He's traitor to th' height.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
Men into such strange mysteries?
SANDYS:
New customs,
Though they be never so ridiculous,
Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.
CHAMBERLAIN:
As far as I see, all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.
SANDYS:
They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,
That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Death! my lord,
Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't,
That sure th' have worn out Christendom.
How now?
What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?
LOVELL:
Faith, my lord,
I hear of none but the new proclamation
That's clapp'd upon the court gate.
CHAMBERLAIN:
What is't for?
LOVELL:
The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.
CHAMBERLAIN:
I am glad 'tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs
To think an English courtier may be wise,
And never see the Louvre.
LOVELL:
They must either,
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France,
With all their honourable points of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto-as fights and fireworks;
Abusing better men than they can be,
Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,
Short blist'red breeches, and those types of travel
And understand again like honest men,
Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,
They may, cum privilegio, wear away
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.
SANDYS:
'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases
Are grown so catching.
CHAMBERLAIN:
What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities!
LOVELL:
Ay, marry,
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
SANDYS:
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,
For sure there's no converting 'em. Now
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,
Held current music too.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Well said, Lord Sandys;
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.
SANDYS:
No, my lord,
Nor shall not while I have a stamp.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Sir Thomas,
Whither were you a-going?
LOVELL:
To the Cardinal's;
Your lordship is a guest too.
CHAMBERLAIN:
O, 'tis true;
This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
To many lords and ladies; there will be
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.
LOVELL:
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
His dews fall everywhere.
CHAMBERLAIN:
No doubt he's noble;
He had a black mouth that said other of him.
SANDYS:
He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
Men of his way should be most liberal,
They are set here for examples.
CHAMBERLAIN:
True, they are so;
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
We shall be late else; which I would not be,
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,
This night to be comptrollers.
SANDYS:
I am your lordship's.
GUILDFORD:
Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace
Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,
In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
One care abroad; he would have all as merry
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
Can make good people.
O, my lord, y'are tardy,
The very thought of this fair company
Clapp'd wings to me.
CHAMBERLAIN:
You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
SANDYS:
Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
Should find a running banquet ere they rested
I think would better please 'em. By my life,
They are a sweet society of fair ones.
LOVELL:
O that your lordship were but now confessor
To one or two of these!
SANDYS:
I would I were;
They should find easy penance.
LOVELL:
Faith, how easy?
SANDYS:
As easy as a down bed would afford it.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this.
His Grace is ent'ring. Nay, you must not freeze:
Two women plac'd together makes cold weather.
My Lord Sandys, you are one will keep 'em waking:
Pray sit between these ladies.
SANDYS:
By my faith,
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
I had it from my father.
ANNE:
Was he mad, sir?
SANDYS:
O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too.
But he would bite none; just as I do now,
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
CHAMBERLAIN:
Well said, my lord.
So, now y'are fairly seated. Gentlemen,
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies
Pass away frowning.
SANDYS:
For my little cure,
Let me alone.
WOLSEY:
Y'are welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady
Or gentleman that is not freely merry
Is not my friend. This, to confirm my welcome-
And to you all, good health!
SANDYS:
Your Grace is noble.
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks
And save me so much talking.
WOLSEY:
My Lord Sandys,
I am beholding to you. Cheer your neighbours.
Ladies, you are not merry. Gentlemen,
Whose fault is this?
SANDYS:
The red wine first must rise
In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
Talk us to silence.
ANNE:
You are a merry gamester,
My Lord Sandys.
SANDYS:
Yes, if I make my play.
Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,
For 'tis to such a thing-
ANNE:
You cannot show me.
SANDYS:
I told your Grace they would talk anon.
WOLSEY:
What's that?
CHAMBERLAIN:
Look out there, some of ye.
WOLSEY:
What warlike voice,
And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not:
By all the laws of war y'are privileg'd.
CHAMBERLAIN:
How now! what is't?
SERVANT:
A noble troop of strangers-
For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed,
And hither make, as great ambassadors
From foreign princes.
WOLSEY:
Good Lord Chamberlain,
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;
And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em
Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.
You have now a broken banquet, but we'll mend it.
A good digestion to you all; and once more
I show'r a welcome on ye; welcome all.
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
CHAMBERLAIN:
Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
To tell your Grace, that, having heard by fame
Of this so noble and so fair assembly
This night to meet here, they could do no less,
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct,
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
An hour of revels with 'em.
WOLSEY:
Say, Lord Chamberlain,
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
KING:
The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,
Till now I never knew thee!
WOLSEY:
My lord!
CHAMBERLAIN:
Your Grace?
WOLSEY:
Pray tell 'em thus much from me:
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
If I but knew him, with my love and duty
I would surrender it.
CHAMBERLAIN:
I will, my lord.
WOLSEY:
What say they?
CHAMBERLAIN:
Such a one, they all confess,
There is indeed; which they would have your Grace
Find out, and he will take it.
WOLSEY:
Let me see, then.
By all your good leaves, gentlemen, here I'll make
My royal choice.
KING:
[Unmasking]
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, Cardinal,
I should judge now unhappily.
WOLSEY:
I am glad
Your Grace is grown so pleasant.
KING:
My Lord Chamberlain,
Prithee come hither: what fair lady's that?
CHAMBERLAIN:
An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's
The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women.
KING:
By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweet heart,
I were unmannerly to take you out
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
Let it go round.
WOLSEY:
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I' th' privy chamber?
LOVELL:
Yes, my lord.
WOLSEY:
Your Grace,
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.
KING:
I fear, too much.
WOLSEY:
There's fresher air, my lord,
In the next chamber.
KING:
Lead in your ladies, ev'ry one. Sweet partner,
I must not yet forsake you. Let's be merry:
Good my Lord Cardinal, I have half a dozen healths
To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Whither away so fast?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
O, God save ye!
Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I'll save you
That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony
Of bringing back the prisoner.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Were you there?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Yes, indeed, was I.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Pray, speak what has happen'd.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
You may guess quickly what.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Is he found guilty?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I am sorry for't.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
So are a number more.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
But, pray, how pass'd it?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke.
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The King's attorney, on the contrary,
Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions,
Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd
To have brought, viva voce, to his face;
At which appear'd against him his surveyor,
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,
Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,
Hopkins, that made this mischief.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
The same.
All these accus'd him strongly, which he fain
Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not;
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
After all this, how did he bear him-self
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
When he was brought again to th' bar to hear
His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd
With such an agony he sweat extremely,
And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I do not think he fears death.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Sure, he does not;
He never was so womanish; the cause
He may a little grieve at.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Certainly
The Cardinal is the end
KING JOHN:
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
CHATILLON:
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
In my behaviour to the majesty,
The borrowed majesty, of England here.
ELINOR:
A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
KING JOHN:
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
CHATILLON:
Philip of France, in right and true behalf
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories,
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
KING JOHN:
What follows if we disallow of this?
CHATILLON:
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
KING JOHN:
Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,
Controlment for controlment- so answer France.
CHATILLON:
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-
The farthest limit of my embassy.
KING JOHN:
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
For ere thou canst report I will be there,
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honourable conduct let him have-
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
ELINOR:
What now, my son! Have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world
Upon the right and party of her son?
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love,
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
KING JOHN:
Our strong possession and our right for us!
ELINOR:
Your strong possession much more than your right,
Or else it must go wrong with you and me;
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
ESSEX:
My liege, here is the strangest controversy
Come from the country to be judg'd by you
That e'er I heard. Shall I produce the men?
KING JOHN:
Let them approach.
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expedition's charge.
What men are you?
BASTARD:
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge-
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
KING JOHN:
What art thou?
ROBERT:
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
KING JOHN:
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.
BASTARD:
Most certain of one mother, mighty king-
That is well known- and, as I think, one father;
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother.
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
ELINOR:
Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
BASTARD:
I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-
That is my brother's plea, and none of mine;
The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out
At least from fair five hundred pound a year.
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
KING JOHN:
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
BASTARD:
I know not why, except to get the land.
But once he slander'd me with bastardy;
But whe'er I be as true begot or no,
That still I lay upon my mother's head;
But that I am as well begot, my liege-
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!-
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
If old Sir Robert did beget us both
And were our father, and this son like him-
O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
KING JOHN:
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
ELINOR:
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man?
KING JOHN:
Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
BASTARD:
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
With half that face would he have all my land:
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
ROBERT:
My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,
Your brother did employ my father much-
BASTARD:
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
ROBERT:
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
To Germany, there with the Emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
Th' advantage of his absence took the King,
And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak-
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay,
As I have heard my father speak himself,
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
His lands to me, and took it on his death
That this my mother's son was none of his;
And if he were, he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
My father's land, as was my father's will.
KING JOHN:
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Your father's heir must have your father's land.
ROBERT:
Shall then my father's will be of no force
To dispossess that child which is not his?
BASTARD:
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Than was his will to get me, as I think.
ELINOR:
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
BASTARD:
Madam, an if my brother had my shape
And I had his, Sir Robert's his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say 'Look where three-farthings goes!'
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land-
Would I might never stir from off this place,
I would give it every foot to have this face!
I would not be Sir Nob in any case.
ELINOR:
I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
I am a soldier and now bound to France.
BASTARD:
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
Yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
ELINOR:
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
BASTARD:
Our country manners give our betters way.
KING JOHN:
What is thy name?
BASTARD:
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:
Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
KING JOHN:
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great-
Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.
BASTARD:
Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
When I was got, Sir Robert was away!
ELINOR:
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam, Richard: call me so.
BASTARD:
Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
Something about, a little from the right,
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch;
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night;
And have is have, however men do catch.
Near or far off, well won is still well shot;
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
KING JOHN:
Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
For France, for France, for it is more than need.
BASTARD:
Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!
For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.
A foot of honour better than I was;
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
For new-made honour doth forget men's names:
'Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-
And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,
At your employment, at your service, sir!'
'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
Saving in dialogue of compliment,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
The Pyrenean and the river Po-
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
But this is worshipful society,
And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
For he is but a bastard to the time
That doth not smack of observation-
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
O me, 'tis my mother! How now, good lady!
What brings you here to court so hastily?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Where is that slave, thy brother?
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
BASTARD:
My brother Robert, old Sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Is it Sir Robert's son that you seek so?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
Sir Robert's son! Why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert?
He is Sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
BASTARD:
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
GURNEY:
Good leave, good Philip.
BASTARD:
Philip-Sparrow! James,
There's toys abroad-anon I'll tell thee more.
Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son;
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good Friday, and ne'er broke his fast.
Sir Robert could do: well-marry, to confess-
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
BASTARD:
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
What! I am dubb'd; I have it on my shoulder.
But, mother, I am not Sir Robert's son:
I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land;
Legitimation, name, and all is gone.
Then, good my mother, let me know my father-
Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
BASTARD:
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE:
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.
By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
To make room for him in my husband's bed.
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence.
BASTARD:
Now, by this light, were I to get again,
Madam, I would not wish a better father.
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
Subjected tribute to commanding love,
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
And they shall say when Richard me begot,
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.
Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.
KING PHILIP:
Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
By this brave duke came early to his grave;
And for amends to his posterity,
At our importance hither is he come
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf;
And to rebuke the usurpation
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
ARTHUR:
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
The rather that you give his offspring life,
Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
But with a heart full of unstained love;
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.
KING PHILIP:
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
AUSTRIA:
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
As seal to this indenture of my love:
That to my home I will no more return
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore,
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders-
Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,
That water-walled bulwark, still secure
And confident from foreign purposes-
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king. Till then, fair boy,
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
CONSTANCE:
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love!
AUSTRIA:
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war.
KING PHILIP:
Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent
Against the brows of this resisting town;
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
To cull the plots of best advantages.
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
But we will make it subject to this boy.
CONSTANCE:
Stay for an answer to your embassy,
Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war,
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
KING PHILIP:
A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,
Our messenger Chatillon is arriv'd.
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
We coldly pause for thee. Chatillon, speak.
CHATILLON:
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task.
England, impatient of your just demands,
Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
To land his legions all as soon as I;
His marches are expedient to this town,
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
With him along is come the mother-queen,
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
With her the Lady Blanch of Spain;
With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd;
And all th' unsettled humours of the land-
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens-
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
Did never float upon the swelling tide
To do offence and scathe in Christendom.
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand;
To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.
KING PHILIP:
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
AUSTRIA:
By how much unexpected, by so much
We must awake endeavour for defence,
For courage mounteth with occasion.
Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.
KING JOHN:
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own!
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven!
KING PHILIP:
Peace be to England, if that war return
From France to England, there to live in peace!
England we love, and for that England's sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat.
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
But thou from loving England art so far
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,
Cut off the sequence of posterity,
Outfaced infant state, and done a rape
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face:
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right,
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God,
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
When living blood doth in these temples beat
Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest?
KING JOHN:
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
To draw my answer from thy articles?
KING PHILIP:
From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
In any breast of strong authority
To look into the blots and stains of right.
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
KING JOHN:
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
KING PHILIP:
Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
ELINOR:
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
CONSTANCE:
Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
ELINOR:
Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,
That thou mayst be a queen and check the world!
CONSTANCE:
My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners-being as Eke
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
His father never was so true begot;
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.
ELINOR:
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
CONSTANCE:
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
AUSTRIA:
Peace!
BASTARD:
Hear the crier.
AUSTRIA:
What the devil art thou?
BASTARD:
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
An 'a may catch your hide and you alone.
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;
I'll smoke your skin-coat an I catch you right;
Sirrah, look to 't; i' faith I will, i' faith.
BLANCH:
O, well did he become that lion's robe
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
BASTARD:
It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass;
But, ass, I'll take that burden from your back,
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
AUSTRIA:
What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath?
King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.
KING PHILIP:
Women and fools, break off your conference.
King John, this is the very sum of all:
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
In right of Arthur, do I claim of thee;
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
KING JOHN:
My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
Arthur of Britaine, yield thee to my hand,
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win.
Submit thee, boy.
ELINOR:
Come to thy grandam, child.
CONSTANCE:
Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.
There's a good grandam!
ARTHUR:
Good my mother, peace!
I would that I were low laid in my grave:
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.
ELINOR:
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
CONSTANCE:
Now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib'd
To do him justice and revenge on you.
ELINOR:
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
CONSTANCE:
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
Call not me slanderer! Thou and thine usurp
The dominations, royalties, and rights,
Of this oppressed boy; this is thy eldest son's son,
Infortunate in nothing but in thee.
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
The canon of the law is laid on him,
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
KING JOHN:
Bedlam, have done.
CONSTANCE:
I have but this to say-
That he is not only plagued for her sin,
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue, plagued for her
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
Her injury the beadle to her sin;
All punish'd in the person of this child,
And all for her-a plague upon her!
ELINOR:
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son.
CONSTANCE:
Ay, who doubts that? A will, a wicked will;
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
KING PHILIP:
Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
To these ill-tuned repetitions.
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
These men of Angiers; let us hear them speak
Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.
CITIZEN:
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
KING PHILIP:
'Tis France, for England.
KING JOHN:
England for itself.
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects-
KING PHILIP:
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle-
KING JOHN:
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France, that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
Have hither march'd to your endamagement;
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls;
All preparation for a bloody siege
And merciless proceeding by these French
Confront your city's eyes, your winking gates;
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
That as a waist doth girdle you about
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king,
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
To save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned cheeks-
Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle;
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
To make a faithless error in your cars;
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
And let us in-your King, whose labour'd spirits,
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
Craves harbourage within your city walls.
KING PHILIP:
When I have said, make answer to us both.
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
Son to the elder brother of this man,
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys;
For this down-trodden equity we tread
In warlike march these greens before your town,
Being no further enemy to you
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
In the relief of this oppressed child
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To him that owes it, namely, this young prince;
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
Against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven;
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,
We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town,
And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls
Can hide you from our messengers of war,
Though all these English and their discipline
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord
In that behalf which we have challeng'd it;
Or shall we give the signal to our rage,
And stalk in blood to our possession?
CITIZEN:
In brief: we are the King of England's subjects;
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
KING JOHN:
Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
CITIZEN:
That can we not; but he that proves the King,
To him will we prove loyal. Till that time
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
KING JOHN:
Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses:
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed-
BASTARD:
Bastards and else.
KING JOHN:
To verify our title with their lives.
KING PHILIP:
As many and as well-born bloods as those-
BASTARD:
Some bastards too.
KING PHILIP:
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
CITIZEN:
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
KING JOHN:
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence,
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
KING PHILIP:
Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
BASTARD:
Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since
Sits on's horse back at mine hostess' door,
Teach us some fence! Sirrah, were I at home,
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
And make a monster of you.
AUSTRIA:
Peace! no more.
BASTARD:
O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
KING JOHN:
Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth
In best appointment all our regiments.
BASTARD:
Speed then to take advantage of the field.
KING PHILIP:
It shall be so; and at the other hill
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
Here, after excursions, enter the HERALD OF FRANCE,
FRENCH HERALD:
You men of Angiers, open wide your gates
And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,
Who by the hand of France this day hath made
Much work for tears in many an English mother,
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
And victory with little loss doth play
Upon the dancing banners of the French,
Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed,
To enter conquerors, and to proclaim
Arthur of Britaine England's King and yours.
ENGLISH HERALD:
Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
King John, your king and England's, doth approach,
Commander of this hot malicious day.
Their armours that march'd hence so silver-bright
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood.
There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France;
Our colours do return in those same hands
That did display them when we first march'd forth;
And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes.
Open your gates and give the victors way.
CITIZEN:
Heralds, from off our tow'rs we might behold
From first to last the onset and retire
Of both your armies, whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censured.
Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows;
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power;
Both are alike, and both alike we like.
One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several doors
KING JOHN:
France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Say, shall the current of our right run on?
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
KING PHILIP:
England, thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
In this hot trial more than we of France;
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
Or add a royal number to the dead,
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
BASTARD:
Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
In undetermin'd differences of kings.
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
Then let confusion of one part confirm
The other's peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death!
KING JOHN:
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
KING PHILIP:
Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
CITIZEN:
The King of England, when we know the King.
KING PHILIP:
Know him in us that here hold up his right.
KING JOHN:
In us that are our own great deputy
And bear possession of our person here,
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
CITIZEN:
A greater pow'r than we denies all this;
And till it be undoubted, we do lock
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolv'd,
Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd.
BASTARD:
By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
And stand securely on their battlements
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Your royal presences be rul'd by me:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon, charged to the mouths,
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city.
I'd play incessantly upon these jades,
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
That done, dissever your united strengths
And part your mingled colours once again,
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion,
To whom in favour she shall give the day,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
Smacks it not something of the policy?
KING JOHN:
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
I like it well. France, shall we knit our pow'rs
And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
Then after fight who shall be king of it?
BASTARD:
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
Why then defy each other, and pell-mell
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
KING PHILIP:
Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
KING JOHN:
We from the west will send destruction
Into this city's bosom.
AUSTRIA:
I from the north.
KING PHILIP:
Our thunder from the south
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
BASTARD:
[Aside]
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth.
I'll stir them to it.-Come, away, away!
CITIZEN:
Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
And I shall show you peace and fair-fac'd league;
Win you this city without stroke or wound;
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
That here come sacrifices for the field.
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
KING JOHN:
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
CITIZEN:
That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
Is niece to England; look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
Is the young Dauphin every way complete-
If not complete of, say he is not she;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
If want it be not that she is not he.
He is the half part of a blessed man,
Left to be finished by such as she;
And she a fair divided excellence,
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
O, two such silver currents, when they join,
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
Two such controlling bounds, shall you be, Kings,
To these two princes, if you marry them.
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
And give you entrance; but without this match,
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
More free from motion-no, not Death himself
In mortal fury half so peremptory
As we to keep this city.
BASTARD:
Here's a stay
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon-fire, and smoke and bounce;
He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France.
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
ELINOR:
Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
Give with our niece a dowry large enough;
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
I see a yielding in the looks of France;
Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls
Are capable of this ambition,
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse,
Cool and congeal again to what it was.
CITIZEN:
Why answer not the double majesties
This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town?
KING PHILIP:
Speak England first, that hath been forward first
To speak unto this city: what say you?
KING JOHN:
If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen;
For Anjou, and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
And all that we upon this side the sea-
Except this city now by us besieg'd-
Find liable to our crown and dignity,
Shall gild her bridal bed, and make her rich
In titles, honours, and promotions,
As she in beauty, education, blood,
Holds hand with any princess of the world.
KING PHILIP:
What say'st thou, boy? Look in the lady's face.
LEWIS:
I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye;
Which, being but the shadow of your son,
Becomes a sun, and makes your son a shadow.
I do protest I never lov'd myself
Till now infixed I beheld myself
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
BASTARD:
[Aside]
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow,
And quarter'd in her heart-he doth espy
Himself love's traitor. This is pity now,
That hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be
In such a love so vile a lout as he.
BLANCH:
My uncle's will in this respect is mine.
If he see aught in you that makes him like,
That anything he sees which moves his liking
I can with ease translate it to my will;
Or if you will, to speak more properly,
I will enforce it eas'ly to my love.
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
That all I see in you is worthy love,
Than this: that nothing do I see in you-
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge-
That I can find should merit any hate.
KING JOHN:
What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
BLANCH:
That she is bound in honour still to do
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
KING JOHN:
Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
LEWIS:
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
For I do love her most unfeignedly.
KING JOHN:
Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,
With her to thee; and this addition more,
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
Philip of France, if thou be pleas'd withal,
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
KING PHILIP:
It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
AUSTRIA:
And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
That I did so when I was first assur'd.
KING PHILIP:
Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
Let in that amity which you have made;
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd.
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
I know she is not; for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much.
Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.
LEWIS:
She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.
KING PHILIP:
And, by my faith, this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure.
Brother of England, how may we content
This widow lady? In her right we came;
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
To our own vantage.
KING JOHN:
We will heal up all,
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine,
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity. I trust we shall,
If not fill up the measure of her will,
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
That we shall stop her exclamation.
Go we as well as haste will suffer us
To this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.
BASTARD:
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole,
Hath willingly departed with a part;
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Who having no external thing to lose
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that;
That smooth-fac'd gentleman, tickling commodity,
Commodity, the bias of the world-
The world, who of itself is peised well,
Made to run even upon even ground,
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
This sway of motion, this commodity,
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
From all direction, purpose, course, intent-
And this same bias, this commodity,
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid,
From a resolv'd and honourable war,
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
And why rail I on this commodity?
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet;
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
When his fair angels would salute my palm,
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich.
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary.
Since kings break faith upon commodity,
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.
CONSTANCE:
Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood join'd! Gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;
Be well advis'd, tell o'er thy tale again.
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so;
I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man:
Believe me I do not believe thee, man;
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
For I am sick and capable of fears,
Oppress'd with wrongs, and therefore full of fears;
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
But they will quake and tremble all this day.
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again-not all thy former tale,
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
SALISBURY:
As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true.
CONSTANCE:
O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die;
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die!
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?
France friend with England; what becomes of me?
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight;
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
SALISBURY:
What other harm have I, good lady, done
But spoke the harm that is by others done?
CONSTANCE:
Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
ARTHUR:
I do beseech you, madam, be content.
CONSTANCE:
If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim,
Ugly, and sland'rous to thy mother's womb,
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
I would not care, I then would be content;
For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou
Become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O!
She is corrupted, chang'd, and won from thee;
Sh' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John-
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to under-bear.
SALISBURY:
Pardon me, madam,
I may not go without you to the kings.
CONSTANCE:
Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee;
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,
For grief is proud, and makes his owner stoop.
To me, and to the state of my great grief,
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up.
Here I and sorrows sit;
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
KING PHILIP:
'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
Ever in France shall be kept festival.
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
Turning with splendour of his precious eye
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold.
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holiday.
CONSTANCE:
[Rising]
What hath this day deserv'd? what hath it done
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
This day of shame, oppression, perjury;
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd;
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
No bargains break that are not this day made;
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
KING PHILIP:
By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
CONSTANCE:
You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
Proves valueless; you are forsworn, forsworn;
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjur'd kings!
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings!
Hear me, O, hear me!
AUSTRIA:
Lady Constance, peace!
CONSTANCE:
War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war.
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villainy!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! Thou art perjur'd too,
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength,
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide! Doff it for shame,
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
O that a man should speak those words to me!
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
KING JOHN:
We like not this: thou dost forget thyself.
KING PHILIP:
Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
PANDULPH:
Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
KING JOHN:
What earthly name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous,
To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we under heaven are supreme head,
So, under Him that great supremacy,
Where we do reign we will alone uphold,
Without th' assistance of a mortal hand.
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurp'd authority.
KING PHILIP:
Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
KING JOHN:
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself-
Though you and all the rest, so grossly led,
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish;
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.
PANDULPH:
Then by the lawful power that I have
Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate;
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
Canonized, and worshipp'd as a saint,
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life.
CONSTANCE:
O, lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Good father Cardinal, cry thou 'amen'
To my keen curses; for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
PANDULPH:
There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
CONSTANCE:
And for mine too; when law can do no right,
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong;
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
PANDULPH:
Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
And raise the power of France upon his head,
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
ELINOR:
Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
CONSTANCE:
Look to that, devil, lest that France repent
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
AUSTRIA:
King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
BASTARD:
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA:
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
Because-
BASTARD:
Your breeches best may carry them.
KING JOHN:
Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
CONSTANCE:
What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
LEWIS:
Bethink you, father; for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
Or the light loss of England for a friend.
Forgo the easier.
BLANCH:
That's the curse of Rome.
CONSTANCE:
O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
BLANCH:
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
But from her need.
CONSTANCE:
O, if thou grant my need,
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
That need must needs infer this principle-
That faith would live again by death of need.
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up:
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
KING JOHN:
The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
CONSTANCE:
O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
AUSTRIA:
Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
BASTARD:
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
KING PHILIP:
I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
PANDULPH:
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
If thou stand excommunicate and curs'd?
KING PHILIP:
Good reverend father, make my person yours,
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married in league, coupled and link'd together
With all religious strength of sacred vows;
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love,
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves;
And even before this truce, but new before,
No longer than we well could wash our hands,
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings.
And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
My reverend father, let it not be so!
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose,
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure, and continue friends.
PANDULPH:
All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore, to arms! be champion of our church,
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse-
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
KING PHILIP:
I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
PANDULPH:
So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith;
And like. a civil war set'st oath to oath.
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
That is, to be the champion of our Church.
What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself,
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done;
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it;
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
It is religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath; the truth thou art unsure
To swear swears only not to be forsworn;
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions;
Upon which better part our pray'rs come in,
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
The peril of our curses fight on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under the black weight.
AUSTRIA:
Rebellion, flat rebellion!
BASTARD:
Will't not be?
Will not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine?
LEWIS:
Father, to arms!
BLANCH:
Upon thy wedding-day?
Against the blood that thou hast married?
What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
Is 'husband' in my mouth! even for that name,
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
Against mine uncle.
CONSTANCE:
O, upon my knee,
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven!
BLANCH:
Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
CONSTANCE:
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
His honour. O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
LEWIS:
I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
When such profound respects do pull you on.
PANDULPH:
I will denounce a curse upon his head.
KING PHILIP:
Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
CONSTANCE:
O fair return of banish'd majesty!
ELINOR:
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
KING JOHN:
France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
BASTARD:
Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
Is it as he will? Well then, France shall rue.
BLANCH:
The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu!
Which is the side that I must go withal?
I am with both: each army hath a hand;
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
They whirl asunder and dismember me.
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive.
Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose:
Assured loss before the match be play'd.
LEWIS:
Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
BLANCH:
There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
KING JOHN:
Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
The blood, and dearest-valu'd blood, of France.
KING PHILIP:
Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire.
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.
KING JOHN:
No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!
BASTARD:
Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
Some airy devil hovers in the sky
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
While Philip breathes.
KING JOHN:
Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:
My mother is assailed in our tent,
And ta'en, I fear.
BASTARD:
My lord, I rescued her;
Her Highness is in safety, fear you not;
But on, my liege, for very little pains
Will bring this labour to an happy end.
KING JOHN:
[To ELINOR]
So strongly guarded. Cousin, look not sad;
Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was.
ARTHUR:
O, this will make my mother die with grief!
KING JOHN:
[To the BASTARD]
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
Set at liberty; the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon.
Use our commission in his utmost force.
BASTARD:
Bell, book, and candle, shall not drive me back,
When gold and silver becks me to come on.
I leave your Highness. Grandam, I will pray,
If ever I remember to be holy,
For your fair safety. So, I kiss your hand.
ELINOR:
Farewell, gentle cousin.
KING JOHN:
Coz, farewell.
ELINOR:
Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
KING JOHN:
Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
We owe thee much! Within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor,
And with advantage means to pay thy love;
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say-
But I will fit it with some better time.
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham'd
To say what good respect I have of thee.
HUBERT:
I am much bounden to your Majesty.
KING JOHN:
Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say-but let it go:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience. If the midnight bell
Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
A passion hateful to my purposes;
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine cars, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words-
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.
But, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well;
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
HUBERT:
So well that what you bid me undertake,
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
By heaven, I would do it.
KING JOHN:
Do not I know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy. I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way;
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.
HUBERT:
And I'll keep him so
That he shall not offend your Majesty.
KING JOHN:
Death.
HUBERT:
My lord?
KING JOHN:
A grave.
HUBERT:
He shall not live.
KING JOHN:
Enough!
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee.
Remember. Madam, fare you well;
I'll send those powers o'er to your Majesty.
ELINOR:
My blessing go with thee!
KING JOHN:
[To ARTHUR]
Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!
KING PHILIP:
So by a roaring tempest on the flood
A whole armado of convicted sail
Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowship.
PANDULPH:
Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
KING PHILIP:
What can go well, when we have run so ill.
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
Arthur ta'en prisoner? Divers dear friends slain?
And bloody England into England gone,
O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
LEWIS:
he hath won, that hath he fortified;
So hot a speed with such advice dispos'd,
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
Doth want example; who hath read or heard
Of any kindred action like to this?
KING PHILIP:
Well could I bear that England had this praise,
So we could find some pattern of our shame.
Look who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
Holding th' eternal spirit, against her will,
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
I prithee, lady, go away with me.
CONSTANCE:
Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
KING PHILIP:
Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
CONSTANCE:
No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
But that which ends all counsel, true redress-
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness!
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones,
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,
And ring these fingers with thy household worms,
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
And be a carrion monster like thyself.
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil'st,
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
O, come to me!
KING PHILIP:
O fair affliction, peace!
CONSTANCE:
No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
Then with a passion would I shake the world,
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
Which scorns a modern invocation.
PANDULPH:
Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
CONSTANCE:
Thou art not holy to belie me so.
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.
I am not mad-I would to heaven I were!
For then 'tis like I should forget myself.
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canoniz'd, Cardinal;
For, being not mad, but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
If I were mad I should forget my son,
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.
KING PHILIP:
Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall'n,
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
Sticking together in calamity.
CONSTANCE:
To England, if you will.
KING PHILIP:
Bind up your hairs.
CONSTANCE:
Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
I tore them from their bonds, and cried aloud
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
But now I envy at their liberty,
And will again commit them to their bonds,
Because my poor child is a prisoner.
And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven;
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit;
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him. Therefore never, never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
PANDULPH:
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
CONSTANCE:
He talks to me that never had a son.
KING PHILIP:
You are as fond of grief as of your child.
CONSTANCE:
Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
Then have I reason to be fond of grief.
Fare you well; had you such a loss as I,
I could give better comfort than you do.
I will not keep this form upon my head,
When there is such disorder in my wit.
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
My life, my joy, my food, my ail the world!
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
KING PHILIP:
I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
LEWIS:
There's nothing in this world can make me joy.
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
PANDULPH:
Before the curing of a strong disease,
Even in the instant of repair and health,
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave
On their departure most of all show evil;
What have you lost by losing of this day?
LEWIS:
All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
PANDULPH:
If you had won it, certainly you had.
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
She looks upon them with a threat'ning eye.
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
In this which he accounts so clearly won.
Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner?
LEWIS:
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
PANDULPH:
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
Out of the path which shall directly lead
Thy foot to England's throne. And therefore mark:
John hath seiz'd Arthur; and it cannot be
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
The misplac'd John should entertain an hour,
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd,
And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up;
That John may stand then, Arthur needs must fall;
So be it, for it cannot be but so.
LEWIS:
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
PANDULPH:
You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
LEWIS:
And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
PANDULPH:
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act, so evilly borne, shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
No common wind, no customed event,
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
LEWIS:
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
PANDULPH:
O, Sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him,
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have nam'd! The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England ransacking the Church,
Offending charity; if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a can
To train ten thousand English to their side;
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the King. 'Tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topful of offence.
For England go; I will whet on the King.
LEWIS:
Strong reasons makes strong actions. Let us go;
If you say ay, the King will not say no.
HUBERT:
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras. When I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair. Be heedful; hence, and watch.
EXECUTIONER:
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
HUBERT:
Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you. Look to't.
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
ARTHUR:
Good morrow, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Good morrow, little Prince.
ARTHUR:
As little prince, having so great a tide
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
HUBERT:
Indeed I have been merrier.
ARTHUR:
Mercy on me!
Methinks no body should be sad but I;
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
I should be as merry as the day is long;
And so I would be here but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me;
He is afraid of me, and I of him.
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
No, indeed, ist not; and I would to heaven
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
HUBERT:
[Aside]
He will awake my mercy, which lies dead;
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
ARTHUR:
Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day;
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
That I might sit all night and watch with you.
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
HUBERT:
[Aside]
Read here, young Arthur.
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
I must be brief, lest resolution drop
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.-
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
ARTHUR:
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
HUBERT:
Young boy, I must.
ARTHUR:
And will you?
HUBERT:
And I will.
ARTHUR:
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
I knit my handkerchief about your brows-
The best I had, a princess wrought it me-
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head;
And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
Saying 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
Many a poor man's son would have lyen still,
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
But you at your sick service had a prince.
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.
If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill,
Why, then you must. Will you put out mine eyes,
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you?
HUBERT:
I have sworn to do it;
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
ARTHUR:
Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears,
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay, after that, consume away in rust
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
I would not have believ'd him-no tongue but Hubert's.
HUBERT:
[Stamps]
Do as I bid you do.
ARTHUR:
O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
HUBERT:
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
ARTHUR:
Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
Nor look upon the iron angrily;
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
Whatever torment you do put me to.
HUBERT:
Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
EXECUTIONER:
I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.
ARTHUR:
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.
Let him come back, that his compassion may
Give life to yours.
HUBERT:
Come, boy, prepare yourself.
ARTHUR:
Is there no remedy?
HUBERT:
None, but to lose your eyes.
ARTHUR:
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
Any annoyance in that precious sense!
Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
HUBERT:
Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
ARTHUR:
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,
Though to no use but still to look on you!
Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold
And would not harm me.
HUBERT:
I can heat it, boy.
ARTHUR:
No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
Being create for comfort, to be us'd
In undeserved extremes. See else yourself:
There is no malice in this burning coal;
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.
HUBERT:
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
ARTHUR:
An if you do, you will but make it blush
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,
And, like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office; only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
HUBERT:
Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
Yet I am sworn, and I did purpose, boy,
With this same very iron to burn them out.
ARTHUR:
O, now you look like Hubert! All this while
You were disguis'd.
HUBERT:
Peace; no more. Adieu.
Your uncle must not know but you are dead:
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports;
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
Will not offend thee.
ARTHUR:
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Silence; no more. Go closely in with me.
Much danger do I undergo for thee.
KING JOHN:
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
PEMBROKE:
This once again, but that your Highness pleas'd,
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any long'd-for change or better state.
SALISBURY:
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
To guard a title that was rich before,
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
PEMBROKE:
But that your royal pleasure must be done,
This act is as an ancient tale new told
And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
Being urged at a time unseasonable.
SALISBURY:
In this the antique and well-noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured;
And like a shifted wind unto a sail
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
Startles and frights consideration,
Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
PEMBROKE:
When workmen strive to do better than well,
They do confound their skill in covetousness;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,
As patches set upon a little breach
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
SALISBURY:
To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness
To overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.
KING JOHN:
Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with, and think them strong;
And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
I shall indue you with. Meantime but ask
What you would have reform'd that is not well,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests.
PEMBROKE:
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
Both for myself and them- but, chief of all,
Your safety, for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies, heartily request
Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument:
If what in rest you have in right you hold,
Why then your fears-which, as they say, attend
The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up
Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise?
That the time's enemies may not have this
To grace occasions, let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty;
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
KING JOHN:
Let it be so. I do commit his youth
To your direction.
PEMBROKE:
This is the man should do the bloody deed:
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
SALISBURY:
The colour of the King doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience,
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.
His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
PEMBROKE:
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
KING JOHN:
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.
SALISBURY:
Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
PEMBROKE:
Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
Before the child himself felt he was sick.
This must be answer'd either here or hence.
KING JOHN:
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
SALISBURY:
It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it.
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
PEMBROKE:
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee
And find th' inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle
Three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while!
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
KING JOHN:
They burn in indignation. I repent.
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
No certain life achiev'd by others' death.
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm.
Pour down thy weather-how goes all in France?
MESSENGER:
From France to England. Never such a pow'r
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,
For when you should be told they do prepare,
The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd.
KING JOHN:
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?
MESSENGER:
My liege, her ear
Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died
Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
Three days before; but this from rumour's tongue
I idly heard-if true or false I know not.
KING JOHN:
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
O, make a league with me, till I have pleas'd
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France
That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?
MESSENGER:
Under the Dauphin.
KING JOHN:
Thou hast made me giddy
With these in tidings.
Now! What says the world
To your proceedings? Do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news, for it is fun.
BASTARD:
But if you be afear'd to hear the worst,
Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head.
KING JOHN:
Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz'd
Under the tide; but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
BASTARD:
How I have sped among the clergymen
The sums I have collected shall express.
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
I find the people strangely fantasied;
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams.
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear;
And here's a prophet that I brought with me
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your Highness should deliver up your crown.
KING JOHN:
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
PETER:
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
KING JOHN:
Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
And on that day at noon whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd.
Deliver him to safety; and return,
For I must use thee.
O my gentle cousin,
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd?
BASTARD:
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
On your suggestion.
KING JOHN:
Gentle kinsman, go
And thrust thyself into their companies.
I have a way to will their loves again;
Bring them before me.
BASTARD:
I Will seek them out.
KING JOHN:
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again.
BASTARD:
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
KING JOHN:
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.
MESSENGER:
With all my heart, my liege.
KING JOHN:
My mother dead!
HUBERT:
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion.
KING JOHN:
Five moons!
HUBERT:
Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously;
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
Told of a many thousand warlike French
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
Another lean unwash'd artificer
Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur's death.
KING JOHN:
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murd'red him. I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
HUBERT:
No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
KING JOHN:
It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law; to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
More upon humour than advis'd respect.
HUBERT:
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
KING JOHN:
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind;
But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
HUBERT:
My lord-
KING JOHN:
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
But thou didst understand me by my signs,
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign pow'rs;
Nay, in the body of the fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
HUBERT:
Arm you against your other enemies,
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Within this bosom never ent'red yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
KING JOHN:
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their incensed rage
And make them tame to their obedience!
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O, answer not; but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
ARTHUR:
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
There's few or none do know me; if they did,
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite.
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
If I get down and do not break my limbs,
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away.
As good to die and go, as die and stay.
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones.
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
SALISBURY:
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury;
It is our safety, and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time.
PEMBROKE:
Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
SALISBURY:
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
Is much more general than these lines import.
BIGOT:
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
SALISBURY:
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
BASTARD:
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
The King by me requests your presence straight.
SALISBURY:
The King hath dispossess'd himself of us.
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Return and tell him so. We know the worst.
BASTARD:
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
SALISBURY:
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
BASTARD:
But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
PEMBROKE:
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
BASTARD:
'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
SALISBURY:
This is the prison. What is he lies here?
PEMBROKE:
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
SALISBURY:
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
BIGOT:
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
SALISBURY:
Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
Or have you read or heard, or could you think?
Or do you almost think, although you see,
That you do see? Could thought, without this object,
Form such another? This is the very top,
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
That ever wall-ey'd wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
PEMBROKE:
All murders past do stand excus'd in this;
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times,
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
BASTARD:
It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
If that it be the work of any hand.
SALISBURY:
If that it be the work of any hand!
We had a kind of light what would ensue.
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
The practice and the purpose of the King;
From whose obedience I forbid my soul
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
Never to be infected with delight,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
Till I have set a glory to this hand
By giving it the worship of revenge.
PEMBROKE:
and BIGOT. Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
HUBERT:
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you.
SALISBURY:
O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
HUBERT:
I am no villain.
SALISBURY:
Must I rob the law?
BASTARD:
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
SALISBURY:
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
HUBERT:
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours.
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
BIGOT:
Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
HUBERT:
Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor.
SALISBURY:
Thou art a murderer.
HUBERT:
Do not prove me so.
Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
PEMBROKE:
Cut him to pieces.
BASTARD:
Keep the peace, I say.
SALISBURY:
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
BASTARD:
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
BIGOT:
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
Second a villain and a murderer?
HUBERT:
Lord Bigot, I am none.
BIGOT:
Who kill'd this prince?
HUBERT:
'Tis not an hour since I left him well.
I honour'd him, I lov'd him, and will weep
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
SALISBURY:
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
For villainy is not without such rheum;
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
BIGOT:
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
PEMBROKE:
There tell the King he may inquire us out.
BASTARD:
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Do but hear me, sir.
BASTARD:
Ha! I'll tell thee what:
Thou'rt damn'd as black-nay, nothing is so black-
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer;
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
HUBERT:
Upon my soul-
BASTARD:
If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up
I do suspect thee very grievously.
HUBERT:
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me!
I left him well.
BASTARD:
Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amaz'd, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty
The life, the right, and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,
And follow me with speed. I'll to the King;
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
KING JOHN:
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
PANDULPH:
[Gives back the crown]
From this my hand, as holding of the Pope,
Your sovereign greatness and authority.
KING JOHN:
Now keep your holy word; go meet the French;
And from his Holiness use all your power
To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd.
Our discontented counties do revolt;
Our people quarrel with obedience,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
This inundation of mistemp'red humour
Rests by you only to be qualified.
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick
That present med'cine must be minist'red
Or overthrow incurable ensues.
PANDULPH:
It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope;
But since you are a gentle convertite,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blust'ring land.
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
Upon your oath of service to the Pope,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
KING JOHN:
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have.
I did suppose it should be on constraint;
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
BASTARD:
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover Castle. London hath receiv'd,
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers.
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
To offer service to your enemy;
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends.
KING JOHN:
Would not my lords return to me again
After they heard young Arthur was alive?
BASTARD. They found him dead, and cast into the streets,
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
By some damn'd hand was robbed and ta'en away.
KING JOHN:
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
BASTARD:
So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye.
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow
Of bragging horror; so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviours from the great,
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away, and glister like the god of war
When he intendeth to become the field;
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
And fright him there, and make him tremble there?
O, let it not be said! Forage, and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors
And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.
KING JOHN:
The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.
BASTARD:
O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
Send fair-play orders, and make compromise,
Insinuation, parley, and base truce,
To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy,
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms.
Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or, if he do, let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence.
KING JOHN:
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
BASTARD:
Away, then, with good courage!
Yet, I know
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
LEWIS:
My Lord Melun, let this be copied out
And keep it safe for our remembrance;
Return the precedent to these lords again,
That, having our fair order written down,
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament,
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
SALISBURY:
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
To your proceedings; yet, believe me, Prince,
I am not glad that such a sore of time
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many. O, it grieves my soul
That I must draw this metal from my side
To be a widow-maker! O, and there
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
But such is the infection of the time
That, for the health and physic of our right,
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
That we, the sons and children of this isle,
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
Wherein we step after a stranger-march
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
Her enemies' ranks-I must withdraw and weep
Upon the spot of this enforced cause-
To grace the gentry of a land remote
And follow unacquainted colours here?
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
LEWIS:
A noble temper dost thou show in this;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect!
Let me wipe off this honourable dew
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
Being an ordinary inundation;
But this effusion of such manly drops,
This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul,
Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors.
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
And with a great heart heave away this storm;
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enrag'd,
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself. So, nobles, shall you all,
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
Look where the holy legate comes apace,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath.
PANDULPH:
Hail, noble prince of France!
The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
That so stood out against the holy Church,
The great metropolis and see of Rome.
Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That, like a lion fostered up at hand,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace
And be no further harmful than in show.
LEWIS:
Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
I am too high-born to be propertied,
To be a secondary at control,
Or useful serving-man and instrument
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right,
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
What men provided, what munition sent,
To underprop this action? Is 't not I
That undergo this charge? Who else but I,
And such as to my claim are liable,
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
Have I not here the best cards for the game
To will this easy match, play'd for a crown?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
PANDULPH:
You look but on the outside of this work.
LEWIS:
Outside or inside, I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war,
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
To outlook conquest, and to will renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
BASTARD:
According to the fair play of the world,
Let me have audience: I am sent to speak.
My holy lord of Milan, from the King
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.
PANDULPH:
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
And will not temporize with my entreaties;
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
BASTARD:
By all the blood that ever fury breath'd,
The youth says well. Now hear our English King;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepar'd, and reason too he should.
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
The King doth smile at; and is well prepar'd
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door.
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
Thinking this voice an armed Englishman-
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No. Know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids,
Like Amazons, come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.
LEWIS:
There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.
PANDULPH:
Give me leave to speak.
BASTARD:
No, I will speak.
LEWIS:
We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war,
Plead for our interest and our being here.
BASTARD:
Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
And echo with the clamour of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine:
Sound but another, and another shall,
As loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand-
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need-
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
LEWIS:
Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
BASTARD:
And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
Exeunt
KING JOHN:
How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
HUBERT:
Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?
KING JOHN:
This fever that hath troubled me so long
Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!
MESSENGER:
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
Desires your Majesty to leave the field
And send him word by me which way you go.
KING JOHN:
Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
MESSENGER:
Be of good comfort; for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here
Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands;
This news was brought to Richard but even now.
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
KING JOHN:
Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead; to my litter straight;
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
SALISBURY:
I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
PEMBROKE:
Up once again; put spirit in the French;
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
SALISBURY:
That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
PEMBROKE:
They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.
MELUN:
Lead me to the revolts of England here.
SALISBURY:
When we were happy we had other names.
PEMBROKE:
It is the Count Melun.
SALISBURY:
Wounded to death.
MELUN:
Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John, and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
And I with him, and many moe with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.
SALISBURY:
May this be possible? May this be true?
MELUN:
Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here, and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Lewis do will the day,
He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east;
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives.
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert, with your King;
The love of him-and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman-
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.
SALISBURY:
We do believe thee; and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
And like a bated and retired flood,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,
And calmly run on in obedience
Even to our ocean, to great King John.
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,
And happy newness, that intends old right.
LEWIS:
The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
When English measure backward their own ground
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
When with a volley of our needless shot,
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
And wound our tott'ring colours clearly up,
Last in the field and almost lords of it!
MESSENGER:
Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
LEWIS:
Here; what news?
MESSENGER:
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
LEWIS:
Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad to-night
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs?
MESSENGER:
Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
LEWIS:
keep good quarter and good care to-night;
The day shall not be up so soon as I
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
HUBERT:
Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
BASTARD:
A friend. What art thou?
HUBERT:
Of the part of England.
BASTARD:
Whither dost thou go?
HUBERT:
What's that to thee? Why may I not demand
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?
BASTARD:
Hubert, I think.
HUBERT:
Thou hast a perfect thought.
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well.
Who art thou?
BASTARD:
Who thou wilt. And if thou please,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets.
HUBERT:
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
BASTARD:
Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
HUBERT:
Why, here walk I in the black brow of night
To find you out.
BASTARD:
Brief, then; and what's the news?
HUBERT:
O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.
BASTARD:
Show me the very wound of this ill news;
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
HUBERT:
The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;
I left him almost speechless and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time
Than if you had at leisure known of this.
BASTARD:
How did he take it; who did taste to him?
HUBERT:
A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King
Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
BASTARD:
Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
HUBERT:
Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
And brought Prince Henry in their company;
At whose request the King hath pardon'd them,
And they are all about his Majesty.
BASTARD:
Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide-
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
Myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
Away, before! conduct me to the King;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
PRINCE HENRY:
It is too late; the life of all his blood
Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain.
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
Foretell the end
FLAVIUS:
Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
FIRST COMMONER:
Why, sir, a carpenter.
MARULLUS:
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?
SECOND COMMONER:
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
but, as you would say, a cobbler.
MARULLUS:
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
SECOND COMMONER:
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
MARULLUS:
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
SECOND COMMONER:
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
MARULLUS:
What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
SECOND COMMONER:
Why, sir, cobble you.
FLAVIUS:
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
SECOND COMMONER:
Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with
awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in
great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
FLAVIUS:
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
SECOND COMMONER:
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar
and to rejoice in his triumph.
MARULLUS:
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
FLAVIUS:
Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
MARULLUS:
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
FLAVIUS:
It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about
And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
CAESAR:
Calpurnia!
CASCA:
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
CAESAR:
Calpurnia!
CALPURNIA:
Here, my lord.
CAESAR:
Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
When he doth run his course. Antonio!
ANTONY:
Caesar, my lord?
CAESAR:
Forget not in your speed, Antonio,
To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.
ANTONY:
I shall remember.
When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.
CAESAR:
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
SOOTHSAYER:
Caesar!
CAESAR:
Ha! Who calls?
CASCA:
Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
CAESAR:
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.
SOOTHSAYER:
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
What man is that?
BRUTUS:
A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
Set him before me let me see his face.
CASSIUS:
Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
CAESAR:
What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
SOOTHSAYER:
Beware the ides of March.
CAESAR:
He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.
CASSIUS:
Will you go see the order of the course?
BRUTUS:
Not I.
CASSIUS:
I pray you, do.
BRUTUS:
I am not gamesome; I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have;
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.
BRUTUS:
Cassius,
Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
Among which number, Cassius, be you one-
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
CASSIUS:
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
BRUTUS:
No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection, by some other things.
CASSIUS:
'Tis just,
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow. I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
BRUTUS:
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?
CASSIUS:
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I your glass
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester, if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
BRUTUS:
What means this shouting? I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king.
CASSIUS:
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
BRUTUS:
I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' the other
And I will look on both indifferently.
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.
CASSIUS:
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life, but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar, so were you;
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow. So indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!
I, as Aeneas our great ancestor
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him I did mark
How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their color fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"
As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone. Shout.
BRUTUS:
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.
CASSIUS:
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age since the great flood
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.
BRUTUS:
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
CASSIUS:
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
BRUTUS:
The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
CASSIUS:
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today.
BRUTUS:
I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
CASSIUS:
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
CAESAR:
Antonio!
ANTONY:
Caesar?
CAESAR:
Let me have men about me that are fat,
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.
ANTONY:
Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.
CAESAR:
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,
He is a great observer, and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at anything.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
CASCA:
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
BRUTUS:
Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad.
CASCA:
Why, you were with him, were you not?
BRUTUS:
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
CASCA:
Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,
BRUTUS:
What was the second noise for?
CASCA:
Why, for that too.
CASSIUS:
They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
CASCA:
Why, for that too.
BRUTUS:
Was the crown offered him thrice?
CASCA:
Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler
than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
shouted.
CASSIUS:
Who offered him the crown?
CASCA:
Why, Antony.
BRUTUS:
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
CASCA:
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was
mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a
crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these
coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all
that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered
it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he
was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it
the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it. And
for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
and receiving the bad air.
CASSIUS:
But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
CASCA:
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
speechless.
BRUTUS:
'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
CASSIUS:
No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
CASCA:
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell
down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do
the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
BRUTUS:
What said he when he came unto himself?
CASCA:
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common
herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet
and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I
might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came
to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss,
he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or
four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and forgave
him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of
them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done
no less.
BRUTUS:
And after that he came, thus sad, away?
CASCA:
Ay.
CASSIUS:
Did Cicero say anything?
CASCA:
Ay, he spoke Greek.
CASSIUS:
To what effect?
CASCA:
Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face
again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I
could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling
scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.
CASSIUS:
Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
CASCA:
No, I am promised forth.
CASSIUS:
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
CASCA:
Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth
the eating.
CASSIUS:
Good, I will expect you.
CASCA:
Do so, farewell, both.
BRUTUS:
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
CASSIUS:
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.
BRUTUS:
And so it is. For this time I will leave you.
Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you, or, if you will,
Come home to me and I will wait for you.
CASSIUS:
I will do so. Till then, think of the world.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see
Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humor me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings, all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
CICERO:
Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
CASCA:
Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds,
But never till tonight, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world too saucy with the gods
Incenses them to send destruction.
CICERO:
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
CASCA:
A common slave- you know him well by sight-
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by
Without annoying me. And there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noonday upon the marketplace,
Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
For I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.
CICERO:
Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
CASCA:
He doth, for he did bid Antonio
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
CICERO:
Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.
CASCA:
Farewell, Cicero.
CASSIUS:
Who's there?
CASCA:
A Roman.
CASSIUS:
Casca, by your voice.
CASCA:
Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
CASSIUS:
A very pleasing night to honest men.
CASCA:
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
CASSIUS:
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
CASCA:
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
CASSIUS:
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men, fools, and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance,
Their natures, and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality, why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
CASCA:
'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
CASSIUS:
Let it be who it is, for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
CASCA:
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king,
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy.
CASSIUS:
I know where I will wear this dagger then:
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.
CASCA:
So can I.
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.
CASSIUS:
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,
What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.
CASCA:
You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.
CASSIUS:
There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets,
And the complexion of the element
In favor's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
CASCA:
Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
CASSIUS:
'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?
CINNA:
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
CASSIUS:
No, it is Casca, one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
CINNA:
I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
CASSIUS:
Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
CINNA:
Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party-
CASSIUS:
Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done,
Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
CINNA:
All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
CASSIUS:
That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
CASCA:
O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,
And that which would appear offense in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
CASSIUS:
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight, and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.
BRUTUS:
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
LUCIUS:
Call'd you, my lord?
BRUTUS:
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
LUCIUS:
I will, my lord.
BRUTUS:
It must be by his death, and, for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round,
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities;
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.
LUCIUS:
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint I found
This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure
It did not lie there when I went to bed.
BRUTUS:
Get you to bed again, it is not day.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
LUCIUS:
I know not, sir.
BRUTUS:
Look in the calendar and bring me word.
LUCIUS:
I will, sir.
BRUTUS:
The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.
Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
LUCIUS:
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.
BRUTUS:
'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
The genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council, and the state of man,
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.
LUCIUS:
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you.
BRUTUS:
Is he alone?
LUCIUS:
No, sir, there are more with him.
BRUTUS:
Do you know them?
LUCIUS:
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor.
BRUTUS:
Let 'em enter.
They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
When evils are most free? O, then, by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;
Hide it in smiles and affability;
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,
CASSIUS:
I think we are too bold upon your rest.
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?
BRUTUS:
I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?
CASSIUS:
Yes, every man of them, and no man here
But honors you, and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
BRUTUS:
He is welcome hither.
CASSIUS:
This, Decius Brutus.
BRUTUS:
He is welcome too.
BRUTUS:
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?
CASSIUS:
Shall I entreat a word?
DECIUS:
Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
CASCA:
No.
CINNA:
O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
CASCA:
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
Which is a great way growing on the south,
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire, and the high east
Stands as the Capitol, directly here.
BRUTUS:
Give me your hands all over, one by one.
CASSIUS:
And let us swear our resolution.
BRUTUS:
No, not an oath. If not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress? What other bond
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
And will not palter? And what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged
That this shall be or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
CASSIUS:
But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
CASCA:
Let us not leave him out.
CINNA:
No, by no means.
METELLUS:
O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion,
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.
BRUTUS:
O, name him not; let us not break with him,
For he will never follow anything
That other men begin.
CASSIUS:
Then leave him out.
CASCA:
Indeed he is not fit.
DECIUS:
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
CASSIUS:
Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all, which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
BRUTUS:
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious,
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.
CASSIUS:
Yet I fear him,
For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-
BRUTUS:
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.
And that were much he should, for he is given
To sports, to wildness, and much company.
TREBONIUS:
There is no fear in him-let him not die,
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.
BRUTUS:
Peace, count the clock.
CASSIUS:
The clock hath stricken three.
TREBONIUS:
'Tis time to part.
CASSIUS:
But it is doubtful yet
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
It may be these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers
May hold him from the Capitol today.
DECIUS:
Never fear that. If he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humor the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
CASSIUS:
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
BRUTUS:
By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
CINNA:
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
METELLUS:
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
BRUTUS:
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
CASSIUS:
The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,
And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.
BRUTUS:
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
With untired spirits and formal constancy.
And so, good morrow to you every one.
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
PORTIA:
Brutus, my lord!
BRUTUS:
Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
PORTIA:
Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper
You suddenly arose and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across;
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks.
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But with an angry waiter of your hand
Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And, could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
BRUTUS:
I am not well in health, and that is all.
PORTIA:
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.
BRUTUS:
Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
PORTIA:
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
You have some sick offense within your mind,
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy and what men tonight
Have had resort to you; for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.
BRUTUS:
Kneel not, gentle Portia.
PORTIA:
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
BRUTUS:
You are my true and honorable wife,
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart.
PORTIA:
If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman, but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
I grant I am a woman, but withal
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience
And not my husband's secrets?
BRUTUS:
O ye gods,
Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.
Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
All the charactery of my sad brows.
Leave me with haste. Lucius, who's that knocks?
LUCIUS:
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
BRUTUS:
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?
LIGARIUS:
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
BRUTUS:
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
LIGARIUS:
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honor.
BRUTUS:
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
LIGARIUS:
By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
And I will strive with things impossible,
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
BRUTUS:
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
LIGARIUS:
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
BRUTUS:
That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
To whom it must be done.
LIGARIUS:
Set on your foot,
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on.
BRUTUS:
Follow me then.
CAESAR:
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
SERVANT:
My lord?
CAESAR:
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
And bring me their opinions of success.
SERVANT:
I will, my lord.
CALPURNIA:
What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.
CAESAR:
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
CALPURNIA:
Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar! These things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.
CAESAR:
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
CALPURNIA:
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
CAESAR:
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
What say the augurers?
SERVANT:
They would not have you to stir forth today.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast.
CAESAR:
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear.
No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
CALPURNIA:
Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth today. Call it my fear
That keeps you in the house and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,
And he shall say you are not well today.
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
CAESAR:
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
DECIUS:
Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!
I come to fetch you to the Senate House.
CAESAR:
And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come today.
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.
CALPURNIA:
Say he is sick.
CAESAR:
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
DECIUS:
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
CAESAR:
The cause is in my will: I will not come,
That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
But, for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know.
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent, and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.
DECIUS:
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate.
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
CAESAR:
And this way have you well expounded it.
DECIUS:
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
And know it now, the Senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for someone to say
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
To your proceeding bids me tell you this,
And reason to my love is liable.
CAESAR:
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
PUBLIUS:
Good morrow,Caesar.
CAESAR:
Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is't o'clock?
BRUTUS:
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
CAESAR:
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
ANTONY:
So to most noble Caesar.
CAESAR:
Bid them prepare within.
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me today;
Be near me, that I may remember you.
TREBONIUS:
Caesar, I will. And so near will I be
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
CAESAR:
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,
And we like friends will straightway go together.
BRUTUS:
[Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
ARTEMIDORUS:
"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come
not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark
well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast
wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men,
and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look
about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods
defend thee!
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
PORTIA:
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?
LUCIUS:
To know my errand, madam.
PORTIA:
I would have had thee there, and here again,
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side!
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?
LUCIUS:
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
PORTIA:
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth; and take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that?
LUCIUS:
I hear none, madam.
PORTIA:
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
LUCIUS:
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
PORTIA:
Come hither, fellow;
Which way hast thou been?
SOOTHSAYER:
At mine own house, good lady.
PORTIA:
What is't o'clock?
SOOTHSAYER:
About the ninth hour, lady.
PORTIA:
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
SOOTHSAYER:
Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol.
PORTIA:
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
SOOTHSAYER:
That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
PORTIA:
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
SOOTHSAYER:
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I'll get me to a place more void and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
PORTIA:
I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry. Come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
CAESAR:
The ides of March are come.
SOOTHSAYER:
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
DECIUS:
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
ARTEMIDORUS:
O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit
That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.
CAESAR:
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
ARTEMIDORUS:
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
CAESAR:
What, is the fellow mad?
PUBLIUS:
Sirrah, give place.
CASSIUS:
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
POPILIUS:
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
CASSIUS:
What enterprise, Popilius?
POPILIUS:
Fare you well.
BRUTUS:
What said Popilius Lena?
CASSIUS:
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
BRUTUS:
Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.
CASSIUS:
Casca,
Be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.
BRUTUS:
Cassius, be constant.
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
CASSIUS:
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
DECIUS:
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
BRUTUS:
He is address'd; press near and second him.
CINNA:
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
CAESAR:
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Caesar and his Senate must redress?
METELLUS:
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart.
CAESAR:
I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
And turn preordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,
Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished.
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.
METELLUS:
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
BRUTUS:
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
CAESAR:
What, Brutus?
CASSIUS:
Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
CAESAR:
I could be well moved, if I were as you;
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;
They are all fire and every one doth shine;
But there's but one in all doth hold his place.
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
And constant do remain to keep him so.
CINNA:
O Caesar-
CAESAR:
Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
DECIUS:
Great Caesar-
CAESAR:
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
CASCA:
Speak, hands, for me!
CAESAR:
Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.
CINNA:
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
CASSIUS:
Some to the common pulpits and cry out
BRUTUS:
People and senators, be not affrighted,
Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.
CASCA:
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
DECIUS:
And Cassius too.
BRUTUS:
Where's Publius?
CINNA:
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
METELLUS:
Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
Should chance-
BRUTUS:
Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,
There is no harm intended to your person,
Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.
CASSIUS:
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.
BRUTUS:
Do so, and let no man abide this deed
But we the doers.
CASSIUS:
Where is Antony?
TREBONIUS:
Fled to his house amazed.
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run
As it were doomsday.
BRUTUS:
Fates, we will know your pleasures.
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
And drawing days out that men stand upon.
CASSIUS:
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
BRUTUS:
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"
CASSIUS:
Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
BRUTUS:
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!
CASSIUS:
So oft as that shall be,
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
The men that gave their country liberty.
DECIUS:
What, shall we forth?
CASSIUS:
Ay, every man away.
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
BRUTUS:
Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
SERVANT:
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;
Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living, but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
BRUTUS:
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,
Depart untouch'd.
SERVANT:
I'll fetch him presently.
BRUTUS:
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
CASSIUS:
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind
That fears him much, and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
BRUTUS:
But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die;
No place will please me so, no means of death,
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.
BRUTUS:
O Antony, beg not your death of us!
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
As, by our hands and this our present act
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done.
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome-
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
CASSIUS:
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.
BRUTUS:
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.
ANTONY:
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
To see thy Antony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,
Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer strucken by many princes
Dost thou here lie!
CASSIUS:
Mark Antony-
ANTONY:
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
CASSIUS:
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
ANTONY:
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
BRUTUS:
Or else were this a savage spectacle.
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
You should be satisfied.
ANTONY:
That's all I seek;
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the marketplace,
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Speak in the order of his funeral.
BRUTUS:
You shall, Mark Antony.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, a word with you.
That Antony speak in his funeral.
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?
BRUTUS:
By your pardon,
I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission,
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
CASSIUS:
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
BRUTUS:
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
And say you do't by our permission,
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral. And you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.
ANTONY:
Be it so,
I do desire no more.
BRUTUS:
Prepare the body then, and follow us.
ANTONY:
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,
And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
SERVANT:
I do, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
SERVANT:
He did receive his letters, and is coming,
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
O Caesar!
ANTONY:
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?
SERVANT:
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
ANTONY:
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace. There shall I try,
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men,
According to the which thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.
CITIZENS:
We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
BRUTUS:
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.
FIRST CITIZEN:
I will hear Brutus speak.
SECOND CITIZEN:
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,
When severally we hear them rendered.
THIRD CITIZEN:
The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
BRUTUS:
Be patient till the last.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be
silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have
respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in your
wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If
there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to
him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his. If
then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is
my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome
more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than
that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I
weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There
is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor,
and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so
rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I
offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If
any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
ALL:
None, Brutus, none.
BRUTUS:
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was
worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had
no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a
place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this I
depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I
have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country
to need my death.
ALL:
Live, Brutus, live, live!
FIRST CITIZEN:
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Let him be Caesar.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Caesar's better parts
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
FIRST CITIZEN:
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and
clamors.
BRUTUS:
My countrymen-
SECOND CITIZEN:
Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Peace, ho!
BRUTUS:
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech
Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
ANTONY:
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
What does he say of Brutus?
THIRD CITIZEN:
He says, for Brutus' sake,
He finds himself beholding to us all.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
FIRST CITIZEN:
This Caesar was a tyrant.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Nay, that's certain.
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
ANTONY:
You gentle Romans-
ALL:
Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
ANTONY:
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them,
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men-
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And sure he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
SECOND CITIZEN:
If thou consider rightly of the matter,
Caesar has had great wrong.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Has he, masters?
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
FIRST CITIZEN:
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
THIRD CITIZEN:
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
ANTONY:
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters! If I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.
Let but the commons hear this testament-
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
ALL:
The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
ANTONY:
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
For if you should, O, what would come of it!
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
ANTONY:
Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I fear I wrong the honorable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
They were traitors. Honorable men!
ALL:
The will! The testament!
SECOND CITIZEN:
They were villains, murtherers. The will!
Read the will!
ANTONY:
You will compel me then to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?
ALL:
Come down.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Descend.
THIRD CITIZEN:
You shall have leave.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
A ring, stand round.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
ANTONY:
Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
ALL:
Stand back; room, bear back!
ANTONY:
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle. I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii.
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;
See what a rent the envious Casca made;
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart,
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
FIRST CITIZEN:
O piteous spectacle!
SECOND CITIZEN:
O noble Caesar!
THIRD CITIZEN:
O woeful day!
FOURTH CITIZEN:
O traitors villains!
FIRST CITIZEN:
O most bloody sight!
SECOND CITIZEN:
We will be revenged.
ALL:
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!
Slay! Let not a traitor live!
ANTONY:
Stay, countrymen.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.
SECOND CITIZEN:
We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with
him.
ANTONY:
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable.
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend, and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
ALL:
We'll mutiny.
FIRST CITIZEN:
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.
ANTONY:
Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ALL:
Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
ANTONY:
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.
You have forgot the will I told you of.
ALL:
Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
ANTONY:
Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
THIRD CITIZEN:
O royal Caesar!
ANTONY:
Hear me with patience.
ALL:
Peace, ho!
ANTONY:
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?
FIRST CITIZEN:
Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Go fetch fire.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Pluck down benches.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Pluck down forms, windows, anything.
ANTONY:
Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt.
How now, fellow?
SERVANT:
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
ANTONY:
Where is he?
SERVANT:
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
ANTONY:
And thither will I straight to visit him.
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
And in this mood will give us anything.
SERVANT:
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
ANTONY:
Be like they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
CINNA:
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
FIRST CITIZEN:
What is your name?
SECOND CITIZEN:
Whither are you going?
THIRD CITIZEN:
Where do you dwell?
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
SECOND CITIZEN:
Answer every man directly.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Ay, and briefly.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Ay, and wisely.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Ay, and truly, you were best.
CINNA:
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I
a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly
and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
SECOND CITIZEN:
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.
You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.
CINNA:
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
FIRST CITIZEN:
As a friend or an enemy?
CINNA:
As a friend.
SECOND CITIZEN:
That matter is answered directly.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
For your dwelling, briefly.
CINNA:
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Your name, sir, truly.
CINNA:
Truly, my name is Cinna.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
CINNA:
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad
verses.
CINNA:
I am not Cinna the conspirator.
FOURTH CITIZEN:
It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his
name out of his heart, and turn him going.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho, firebrands. To
Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and some
to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go!
ANTONY:
These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
OCTAVIUS:
Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
LEPIDUS:
I do consent-
OCTAVIUS:
Prick him down, Antony.
LEPIDUS:
Upon condition Publius shall not live,
Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
ANTONY:
He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
LEPIDUS:
What, shall I find you here?
OCTAVIUS:
Or here, or at the Capitol.
ANTONY:
This is a slight unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?
OCTAVIUS:
So you thought him,
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die
In our black sentence and proscription.
ANTONY:
Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
And though we lay these honors on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears
And graze in commons.
OCTAVIUS:
You may do your will,
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
ANTONY:
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
I do appoint him store of provender.
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:
He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
On objects, arts, and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.
OCTAVIUS:
Let us do so, for we are at the stake,
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
Millions of mischiefs.
BRUTUS:
Stand, ho!
LUCILIUS:
Give the word, ho, and stand.
BRUTUS:
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
LUCILIUS:
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.
BRUTUS:
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone; but if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.
PINDARUS:
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
BRUTUS:
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
How he received you. Let me be resolved.
LUCILIUS:
With courtesy and with respect enough,
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.
BRUTUS:
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
LUCILIUS:
They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.
BRUTUS:
Hark, he is arrived.
March gently on to meet him.
CASSIUS:
Stand, ho!
BRUTUS:
Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
FIRST SOLDIER:
Stand!
SECOND SOLDIER:
Stand!
THIRD SOLDIER:
Stand!
CASSIUS:
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
BRUTUS:
Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
CASSIUS:
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
And when you do them-
BRUTUS:
Cassius, be content,
Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.
CASSIUS:
Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.
BRUTUS:
Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
CASSIUS:
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
BRUTUS:
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
CASSIUS:
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment.
BRUTUS:
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
CASSIUS:
I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
BRUTUS:
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
CASSIUS:
Chastisement?
BRUTUS:
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
CASSIUS:
Brutus, bait not me,
I'll not endure it. You forget yourself
To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
BRUTUS:
Go to, you are not, Cassius.
CASSIUS:
I am.
BRUTUS:
I say you are not.
CASSIUS:
Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.
BRUTUS:
Away, slight man!
CASSIUS:
Is't possible?
BRUTUS:
Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
CASSIUS:
O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
BRUTUS:
All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
CASSIUS:
Is it come to this?
BRUTUS:
You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
CASSIUS:
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say "better"?
BRUTUS:
If you did, I care not.
CASSIUS:
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
BRUTUS:
Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
CASSIUS:
I durst not?
BRUTUS:
No.
CASSIUS:
What, durst not tempt him?
BRUTUS:
For your life you durst not.
CASSIUS:
Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
BRUTUS:
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,
For I can raise no money by vile means.
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection. I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash him to pieces!
CASSIUS:
I denied you not.
BRUTUS:
You did.
CASSIUS:
I did not. He was but a fool
That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
BRUTUS:
I do not, till you practise them on me.
CASSIUS:
You love me not.
BRUTUS:
I do not like your faults.
CASSIUS:
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
BRUTUS:
A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.
CASSIUS:
Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world:
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.
If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
BRUTUS:
Sheathe your dagger.
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,
That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again.
CASSIUS:
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?
BRUTUS:
When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
CASSIUS:
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
BRUTUS:
And my heart too.
CASSIUS:
O Brutus!
BRUTUS:
What's the matter?
CASSIUS:
Have not you love enough to bear with me
When that rash humor which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful?
BRUTUS:
Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
When you are overearnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
POET:
[Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
They be alone.
LUCILIUS:
[Within.] You shall not come to them.
POET:
[Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.
CASSIUS:
How now, what's the matter?
POET:
For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
CASSIUS:
Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
BRUTUS:
Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
CASSIUS:
Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
BRUTUS:
I'll know his humor when he knows his time.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!
CASSIUS:
Away, away, be gone!
BRUTUS:
Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
CASSIUS:
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.
BRUTUS:
Lucius, a bowl of wine!
CASSIUS:
I did not think you could have been so angry.
BRUTUS:
O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
CASSIUS:
Of your philosophy you make no use,
If you give place to accidental evils.
BRUTUS:
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
CASSIUS:
Ha? Portia?
BRUTUS:
She is dead.
CASSIUS:
How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?
BRUTUS:
Impatient of my absence,
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strong- for with her death
That tidings came- with this she fell distract,
And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
CASSIUS:
And died so?
BRUTUS:
Even so.
CASSIUS:
O ye immortal gods!
BRUTUS:
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
CASSIUS:
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
I CANNOT DRINK TOO MUCH OF BRUTUS' LOVE:
Drinks.
BRUTUS:
Come in, Titinius!
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,
And call in question our necessities.
CASSIUS:
Portia, art thou gone?
BRUTUS:
No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
MESSALA:
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
BRUTUS:
With what addition?
MESSALA:
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators.
BRUTUS:
There in our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
CASSIUS:
Cicero one!
MESSALA:
Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
BRUTUS:
No, Messala.
MESSALA:
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
BRUTUS:
Nothing, Messala.
MESSALA:
That, methinks, is strange.
BRUTUS:
Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
MESSALA:
No, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
MESSALA:
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
BRUTUS:
Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
With meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now.
MESSALA:
Even so great men great losses should endure.
CASSIUS:
I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.
BRUTUS:
Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?
CASSIUS:
I do not think it good.
BRUTUS:
Your reason?
CASSIUS:
This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
BRUTUS:
Good reasons must of force give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection,
For they have grudged us contribution.
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.
CASSIUS:
Hear me, good brother.
BRUTUS:
Under your pardon. You must note beside
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
CASSIUS:
Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity,
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
CASSIUS:
No more. Good night.
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.
BRUTUS:
Lucius!
My gown.
Farewell, good Messala;
Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,
Good night and good repose.
CASSIUS:
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night.
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Everything is well.
CASSIUS:
Good night, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Good night, good brother.
TITINIUS:
MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Farewell, everyone.
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
LUCIUS:
Here in the tent.
BRUTUS:
What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.
Call Claudio and some other of my men,
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
LUCIUS:
Varro and Claudio!
VARRO:
Calls my lord?
BRUTUS:
I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.
VARRO:
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
BRUTUS:
I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
LUCIUS:
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
BRUTUS:
Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
LUCIUS:
Ay, my lord, an't please you.
BRUTUS:
It does, my boy.
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
LUCIUS:
It is my duty, sir.
BRUTUS:
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
LUCIUS:
I have slept, my lord, already.
BRUTUS:
It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
I will be good to thee.
This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,
Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou anything?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.
GHOST:
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
BRUTUS:
Why comest thou?
GHOST:
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST:
Ay, at Philippi.
BRUTUS:
Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!
Claudio!
LUCIUS:
The strings, my lord, are false.
BRUTUS:
He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!
LUCIUS:
My lord?
BRUTUS:
Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
LUCIUS:
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
BRUTUS:
Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
LUCIUS:
Nothing, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
VARRO:
My lord?
CLAUDIO:
My lord?
BRUTUS:
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
VARRO:
CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
BRUTUS:
Ay, saw you anything?
VARRO:
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
CLAUDIO:
Nor I, my lord.
BRUTUS:
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
And we will follow.
VARRO:
CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.
OCTAVIUS:
Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.
ANTONY:
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it. They could be content
To visit other places, and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.
MESSENGER:
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
And something to be done immediately.
ANTONY:
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.
OCTAVIUS:
Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
ANTONY:
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
OCTAVIUS:
I do not cross you, but I will do so.
BRUTUS:
They stand, and would have parley.
CASSIUS:
Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
OCTAVIUS:
Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
ANTONY:
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth, the generals would have some words.
OCTAVIUS:
Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
BRUTUS:
Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
OCTAVIUS:
Not that we love words better, as you do.
BRUTUS:
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
ANTONY:
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
Crying "Long live! Hail, Caesar!"
CASSIUS:
Antony,
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless.
ANTONY:
Not stingless too.
BRUTUS:
O, yes, and soundless too,
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting.
ANTONY:
Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
CASSIUS:
Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
This tongue had not offended so today,
If Cassius might have ruled.
OCTAVIUS:
Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look,
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged, or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
BRUTUS:
Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
OCTAVIUS:
So I hope,
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
BRUTUS:
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
CASSIUS:
A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,
Join'd with a masker and a reveler!
ANTONY:
Old Cassius still!
OCTAVIUS:
Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
If you dare fight today, come to the field;
If not, when you have stomachs.
CASSIUS:
Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
BRUTUS:
Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
LUCILIUS:
[Stands forth.] My lord?
CASSIUS:
Messala!
MESSALA:
[Stands forth.] What says my general?
CASSIUS:
Messala,
This is my birthday, as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.
Be thou my witness that, against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong,
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,
Who to Philippi here consorted us.
This morning are they fled away and gone,
And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
MESSALA:
Believe not so.
CASSIUS:
I but believe it partly,
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.
BRUTUS:
Even so, Lucilius.
CASSIUS:
Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods today stand friendly that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together.
What are you then determined to do?
BRUTUS:
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself- I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life- arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.
CASSIUS:
Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?
BRUTUS:
No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun.
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then this parting was well made.
CASSIUS:
Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
BRUTUS:
Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end

A bitter fool!

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll have me

How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you

Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for

Are you our daughter?

Come, sir,

May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?

Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.

Lear's shadow.

I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,

Which they will make an obedient father.

Your name, fair gentlewoman?

This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour

Darkness and devils!

You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble

Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?
ALB:
Pray, sir, be patient.
LEAR:
[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!
ALB:
My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
LEAR:
It may be so, my lord.
ALB:
Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
GON:
Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
LEAR:
What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
ALB:
What's the matter, sir?
LEAR:
I'll tell thee. Life and death! I am asham'd
GON:
Do you mark that, my lord?
ALB:
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
GON:
Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!
FOOL:
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.
GON:
This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?
ALB:
Well, you may fear too far.
GON:
Safer than trust too far.
OSW:
Yes, madam.
GON:
Take you some company, and away to horse!

How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.

Nay then-

Well, well; th' event.

No.

Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

Why?
FOOL:
Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters,

I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses
FOOL:
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars

Because they are not eight?

Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.

To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being

How's that?

Come, boy.

She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,

Save thee, Curan.

And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him

How comes that?

Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the

Not I. Pray you, what are they?

Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes

Not a word.

You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
EDM:
The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
EDG:
I am sure on't, not a word.
EDM:
I hear my father coming. Pardon me!
GLOU:
Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
EDM:
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
GLOU:
But where is he?
EDM:
Look, sir, I bleed.
GLOU:
Where is the villain, Edmund?
EDM:
Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-
GLOU:
Pursue him, ho! Go after. .
EDM:
Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;
GLOU:
Let him fly far.
EDM:
When I dissuaded him from his intent

Strong and fast'ned villain!

How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither
REG:
If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
GLOU:
O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
REG:
What, did my father's godson seek your life?
GLOU:
O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
REG:
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
GLOU:
I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!
EDM:
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
REG:
No marvel then though he were ill affected.
CORN:
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
EDM:
'Twas my duty, sir.

He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd

Is he pursued?
GLOU:
Ay, my good lord.

If he be taken, he shall never more

For him I thank your Grace.

You know not why we came to visit you-

Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
GLOU:
I serve you, madam.
OSW:
Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?
KENT:
Ay.
OSW:
Where may we set our horses?
KENT:
I' th' mire.
OSW:
Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.

I love thee not.
OSW:
Why then, I care not for thee.

If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for
OSW:
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
KENT:
Fellow, I know thee.
OSW:
What dost thou know me for?
KENT:
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
OSW:
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one
KENT:
What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me!
OSW:
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
KENT:
Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and

Help, ho! murther! help!

Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!
OSW:
Help, ho! murther! murther!

How now? What's the matter?

With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh ye!

Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?
CORN:
Keep peace, upon your lives!
REG:
The messengers from our sister and the King
CORN:
What is your difference? Speak.
OSW:
I am scarce in breath, my lord.

No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly

Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?

Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have

Why art thou angry?

GLOU:
How fell you out? Say that.
KENT:
No contraries hold more antipathy
CORN:
Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
KENT:
His countenance likes me not.
CORN:
No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.
KENT:
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
CORN:
This is some fellow
KENT:
Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,

What mean'st by this?

To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I

What was th' offence you gave him?
OSW:
I never gave him any.
KENT:
None of these rogues and cowards

Fetch forth the stocks!

Sir, I am too old to learn.
CORN:
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,

Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
KENT:
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
REG:
Sir, being his knave, I will.
CORN:
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
GLOU:
Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.
CORN:
I'll answer that.
REG:
My sister may receive it much more worse,
GLOU:
I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,
KENT:
Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.
GLOU:
The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

Good King, that must approve the common saw,

I heard myself proclaim'd,

Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

None.

Why, fool?

Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
GLOU:
Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
LEAR:
Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?
GLOU:
Ay, my good lord.
LEAR:
The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father

I would have all well betwixt you.

O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
FOOL:
Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she

Good morrow to you both.

Hail to your Grace!

I am glad to see your Highness.

Regan, I think you are; I know what reason

I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
LEAR:
Say, how is that?
REG:
I cannot think my sister in the least

My curses on her!
REG:
O, sir, you are old!
LEAR:
Ask her forgiveness?

Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.

CORN:
Fie, sir, fie!
LEAR:
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames

O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
LEAR:
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
REG:
Good sir, to th' purpose.
LEAR:
Who put my man i' th' stocks?
CORN:
What trumpet's that?
REG:
I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,

This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride

What means your Grace?

Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope

Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?

O sides, you are too tough!

I set him there, sir; but his own disorders

You? Did you?

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.

Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
GON:
At your choice, sir.

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
REG:
Not altogether so.
LEAR:
Is this well spoken?

I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
GON:
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
REG:
Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,

I gave you all-
REG:
And in good time you gave it!

Made you my guardians, my depositaries;

And speak't again my lord. No more with me.

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
GON:
Hear, me, my lord.
REG:
What need one?
LEAR:
O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
CORN:
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
REG:
This house is little; the old man and 's people
GON:
'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
REG:
For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
GON:
So am I purpos'd.
CORN:
Followed the old man forth.
GLOU:
The King is in high rage.
CORN:
Whither is he going?
GLOU:
He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.

'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
GON:
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
GLOU:
Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds

O, sir, to wilful men

Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.

Who's there, besides foul weather?

One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

I know you. Where's the King?

Contending with the fretful elements;

But who is with him?

None but the fool, who labours to outjest

Sir, I do know you,

I will talk further with you.

No, do not.

Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?

Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
FOOL:
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!

He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.

The prince of darkness is a gentleman!

Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,

Poor Tom 's acold.
GLOU:
Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer

First let me talk with this philosopher.
KENT:
Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.

I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
EDG:
How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.

Let me ask you one word in private.
KENT:
Importune him once more to go, my lord.
GLOU:
Canst thou blame him?
LEAR:
O, cry you mercy, sir.
EDG:
Tom's acold.

In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.

Come, let's in all.

Let us deal justly.

Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before

Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

She cannot deny it.

Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.

Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?

Get horses for your mistress.

Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

Bind fast his corky arms.

What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider
CORN:
Bind him, I say.
REG:
Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
GLOU:
Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.

To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-

By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done

So white, and such a traitor!
GLOU:
Naughty lady,

Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
REG:
Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
CORN:
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
REG:
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
GLOU:
I have a letter guessingly set down,
CORN:
Cunning.
REG:
And false.
CORN:
Where hast thou sent the King?
GLOU:
To Dover.
REG:
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
CORN:
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
GLOU:
I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.
REG:
Wherefore to Dover, sir?
GLOU:
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
CORN:
See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.

He that will think to live till he be old,

One side will mock another. Th' other too!

If you see vengeance-

How now, you dog?

What do you mean?

My villain!

Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?

Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!

All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?

Out, treacherous villain!
GLOU:
O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.
REG:
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
CORN:
I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.
KING:
Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors- for so you are
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires-
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Berowne, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here.
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein.
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
LONGAVILLE:
I am resolv'd; 'tis but a three years' fast.
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine.
Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
DUMAIN:
My loving lord, Dumain is mortified.
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves;
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,
With all these living in philosophy.
BEROWNE:
I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances,
As: not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food,
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
And not be seen to wink of all the day-
When I was wont to think no harm all night,
And make a dark night too of half the day-
Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
KING:
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
BEROWNE:
Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your Grace,
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
LONGAVILLE:
You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
BEROWNE:
By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end
FIRST WITCH:
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH:
When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
THIRD WITCH:
That will be ere the set of sun.
FIRST WITCH:
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH:
Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH:
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH:
I come, Graymalkin.
ALL:
Paddock calls. Anon!
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
DUNCAN:
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
MALCOLM:
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
SERGEANT:
Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak;
For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like Valor's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave,
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
DUNCAN:
O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!
SERGEANT:
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark.
No sooner justice had, with valor arm'd,
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,
Began a fresh assault.
DUNCAN:
Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo.?
SERGEANT:
Yes,
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot tell-
But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.
DUNCAN:
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.
Who comes here?
MALCOLM THE WORTHY THANE OF ROSS:
LENNOX:
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.
ROSS:
God save the King!
DUNCAN:
Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?
ROSS:
From Fife, great King,
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN:
Great happiness!
ROSS:
That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
DUNCAN:
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
ROSS:
I'll see it done.
DUNCAN:
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
FIRST WITCH:
Where hast thou been, sister?
SECOND WITCH:
Killing swine.
THIRD WITCH:
Sister, where thou?
FIRST WITCH:
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
SECOND WITCH:
I'll give thee a wind.
FIRST WITCH:
Thou'rt kind.
THIRD WITCH:
And I another.
FIRST WITCH:
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid;
He shall live a man forbid.
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.
Look what I have.
SECOND WITCH:
Show me, show me.
FIRST WITCH:
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
THIRD WITCH:
A drum, a drum!
Macbeth doth come.
ALL:
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again, to make up nine.
Peace! The charm's wound up.
MACBETH:
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
BANQUO:
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
MACBETH:
Speak, if you can. What are you?
FIRST WITCH:
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
SECOND WITCH:
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THIRD WITCH:
All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
BANQUO:
Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate.
FIRST WITCH:
Hail!
SECOND WITCH:
Hail!
THIRD WITCH:
Hail!
FIRST WITCH:
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
SECOND WITCH:
Not so happy, yet much happier.
THIRD WITCH:
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
FIRST WITCH:
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
MACBETH:
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence, or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
BANQUO:
The earth hath bubbles as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
MACBETH:
Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
BANQUO:
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
MACBETH:
Your children shall be kings.
BANQUO:
You shall be King.
MACBETH:
And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?
BANQUO:
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
ROSS:
The King hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post, and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
And pour'd them down before him.
ANGUS:
We are sent
To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.
ROSS:
And for an earnest of a greater honor,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.
In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,
For it is thine.
BANQUO:
What, can the devil speak true?
MACBETH:
The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?
ANGUS:
Who was the Thane lives yet,
But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
Have overthrown him.
MACBETH:
[Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind. Thanks for your
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?
BANQUO:
[Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange;
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence-
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
MACBETH:
[Aside.] Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.
Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not.
BANQUO:
Look, how our partner's rapt.
MACBETH:
[Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may
Without my stir.
BANQUO:
New honors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.
MACBETH:
[Aside.] Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
BANQUO:
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
MACBETH:
Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.
BANQUO:
Very gladly.
MACBETH:
Till then, enough. Come, friends.
DUNCAN:
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?
MALCOLM:
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death,
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As 'twere a careless trifle.
DUNCAN:
There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.
MACBETH:
The service and the loyalty lowe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness' part
Is to receive our duties, and our duties
Are to your throne and state, children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honor.
DUNCAN:
Welcome hither.
I have begun to plant thee, and will labor
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
No less to have done so; let me infold thee
And hold thee to my heart.
BANQUO:
There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.
DUNCAN:
My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.
MACBETH:
The rest is labor, which is not used for you.
I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.
DUNCAN:
My worthy Cawdor!
MACBETH:
[Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
DUNCAN:
True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.
It is a peerless kinsman.
LADY MACBETH:
"They met me in the day of success, and I have
learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them
further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I
thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,
and farewell."
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
What is your tidings?
MESSENGER:
The King comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH:
Thou'rt mad to say it!
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.
MESSENGER:
So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH:
Give him tending;
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry, "Hold, hold!"
Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
MACBETH:
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here tonight.
LADY MACBETH:
And when goes hence?
MACBETH:
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
LADY MACBETH:
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under it. He that's coming
Must be provided for; and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch,
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
MACBETH:
We will speak further.
LADY MACBETH:
Only look up clear;
To alter favor ever is to fear.
Leave all the rest to me.
DUNCAN:
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.
BANQUO:
This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
The air is delicate.
DUNCAN:
See, see, our honor'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.
LADY MACBETH:
All our service
In every point twice done, and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.
DUNCAN:
Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest tonight.
LADY MACBETH:
Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.
DUNCAN:
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.
MACBETH:
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly. If the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
With his surcease, success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end
DUKE:
Escalus!
ESCALUS:
My lord.
DUKE:
Of government the properties to unfold
Would seem in me t' affect speech and discourse,
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you; then no more remains
But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able-
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, y'are as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us, Angelo.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply;
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power. What think you of it?
ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.
DUKE:
Look where he comes.
ANGELO:
Always obedient to your Grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.
DUKE:
Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life
That to th' observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise.
Hold, therefore, Angelo-
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.
ANGELO:
Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.
DUKE:
No more evasion!
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well.
To th' hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.
ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.
DUKE:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple: your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand;
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes;
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.
ESCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.
ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.
ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your honour.
LUCIO:
If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition
with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the
King.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Hungary's!
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Amen.
LUCIO:
Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to
sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
'Thou shalt not steal'?
LUCIO:
Ay, that he raz'd.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain
and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steal.
There's not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before
meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
LUCIO:
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was
said.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
No? A dozen times at least.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
What, in metre?
LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any language.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I think, or in any religion.
LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as,
for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all
grace.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet.
Thou art the list.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of
an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French
velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?
LUCIO:
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of
thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin
thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
free.
LUCIO:
Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have
purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
To what, I pray?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Judge.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
To three thousand dolours a year.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Ay, and more.
LUCIO:
A French crown more.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou
art full of error; I am sound.
LUCIO:
Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things
that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast
of thee.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
How now! which of your hips has the most profound
sciatica?
MRS:
OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Who's that, I pray thee?
MRS:
OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.
MRS:
OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him
carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
head to be chopp'd off.
LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art
thou sure of this?
MRS:
OVERDONE. I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.
LUCIO:
Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours
since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.
LUCIO:
Away; let's go learn the truth of it.
MRS:
OVERDONE. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.
How now! what's the news with you?
POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to prison.
MRS:
OVERDONE. Well, what has he done?
POMPEY:
A woman.
MRS:
OVERDONE. But what's his offence?
POMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
MRS:
OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him?
POMPEY:
No; but there's a woman with maid by him. You have not
MRS:
OVERDONE. What proclamation, man?
POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.
MRS:
OVERDONE. And what shall become of those in the city?
POMPEY:
They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that
a wise burgher put in for them.
MRS:
OVERDONE. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pull'd down?
POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.
MRS:
OVERDONE. Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall become of me?
POMPEY:
Come, fear not you: good counsellors lack no clients.
Though you change your place you need not change your trade; I'll
be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you;
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will
be considered.
MRS:
OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.
POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison;
and there's Madam Juliet.
CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
PROVOST:
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
CLAUDIO:
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?
CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty;
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
LUCIO:
If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for
certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment.
What's thy offence, Claudio?
CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.
LUCIO:
What, is't murder?
CLAUDIO:
No.
LUCIO:
Lechery?
CLAUDIO:
Call it so.
PROVOST:
Away, sir; you must go.
CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd
after?
CLAUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed.
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order; this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dow'r
Remaining in the coffer of her friends.
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment,
With character too gross, is writ on Juliet.
LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?
CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the Duke-
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up,
I stagger in. But this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me. 'Tis surely for a name.
LUCIO:
I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy
shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.
CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter,
And there receive her approbation;
Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.
LUCIO:
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like,
which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the
enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus
foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
LUCIO:
Within two hours.
CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away.
DUKE:
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.
FRIAR:
May your Grace speak of it?
DUKE:
My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever lov'd the life removed,
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this.
FRIAR:
Gladly, my lord.
DUKE:
We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds,
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.
FRIAR:
It rested in your Grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas'd;
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.
DUKE:
I do fear, too dreadful.
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo impos'd the office;
Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you.
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.
ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?
ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
LUCIO:
[ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!
ISABELLA:
Who's that which calls?
FRANCISCA:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him:
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn;
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress;
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you answer him.
ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?
LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
ISABELLA:
Why her 'unhappy brother'? Let me ask
The rather, for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella, and his sister.
LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
ISABELLA:
Woe me! For what?
LUCIO:
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.
ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.
LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not- though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
Tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.
ISABELLA:
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
LUCIO:
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embrac'd.
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
ISABELLA:
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?
ISABELLA:
Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.
LUCIO:
She it is.
ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her!
LUCIO:
This is the point.
The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth, one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He- to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo. And that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?
LUCIO:
Has censur'd him
Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath
A warrant for his execution.
ISABELLA:
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?
LUCIO:
Assay the pow'r you have.
ISABELLA:
My power, alas, I doubt!
LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.
ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.
LUCIO:
But speedily.
ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
Commend me to my brother; soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.
LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.
ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.
ANGELO:
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
Their perch, and not their terror.
ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman,
Whom I would save, had a most noble father.
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time coher'd with place, or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of our blood
Could have attain'd th' effect of your own purpose
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.
ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes. What knows the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't,
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
ESCALUS:
Be it as your wisdom will.
ANGELO:
Where is the Provost?
PROVOST:
Here, if it like your honour.
ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning;
Bring him his confessor; let him be prepar'd;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
ESCALUS:
[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall;
Some run from breaks of ice, and answer none,
And some condemned for a fault alone.
ELBOW:
Come, bring them away; if these be good people in a
commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses,
I know no law; bring them away.
ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?
ELBOW:
If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke's constable,
and my name is Elbow; I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring
in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors.
ANGELO:
Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
malefactors?
ELBOW:
If it please your honour, I know not well what they are; but
precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all
profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.
ESCALUS:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
ANGELO:
Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
dost thou not speak, Elbow?
POMPEY:
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
ANGELO:
What are you, sir?
ELBOW:
He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad
woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the
suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a
very ill house too.
ESCALUS:
How know you that?
ELBOW:
My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-
ESCALUS:
How! thy wife!
ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-
ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her therefore?
ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that
this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life,
for it is a naughty house.
ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, constable?
ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have been accus'd in fornication,
adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?
ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in
his face, so she defied him.
POMPEY:
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man,
prove it.
ESCALUS:
Do you hear how he misplaces?
POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your
honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the
house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a
fruit dish, a dish of some three pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.
ESCALUS:
Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.
POMPEY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the
right; but to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as
I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I
said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I
said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you
know, Master Froth, I could not give you three pence again-
FROTH:
No, indeed.
POMPEY:
Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking
the stones of the foresaid prunes-
FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.
POMPEY:
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red,
that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-
FROTH:
All this is true.
POMPEY:
Why, very well then-
ESCALUS:
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was
done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me
to what was done to her.
POMPEY:
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
ESCALUS:
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
POMPEY:
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's leave. And,
I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of
fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas- was't not
at Hallowmas, Master Froth?
FROTH:
All-hallond eve.
POMPEY:
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as
I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in the Bunch of Grapes,
where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?
FROTH:
I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.
POMPEY:
Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.
ANGELO:
This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
once more?
POMPEY:
Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.
ELBOW:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
POMPEY:
I beseech your honour, ask me.
ESCALUS:
Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. Good
Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a good purpose. Doth
your honour mark his face?
ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.
POMPEY:
Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
ESCALUS:
Well, I do so.
POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
ESCALUS:
Why, no.
POMPEY:
I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing
about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him,
how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would
know that of your honour.
ESCALUS:
He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next,
this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected
woman.
POMPEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than
any of us all.
ELBOW:
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is
yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or
child.
POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
ESCALUS:
Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this
true?
ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I
respected with her before I was married to her! If ever I was
respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me
the poor Duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I'll have mine action of batt'ry on thee.
ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your
action of slander too.
ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your
worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that
thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his
courses till thou know'st what they are.
ELBOW:
Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked
varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now,
thou varlet; thou art to continue.
ESCALUS:
Where were you born, friend?
FROTH:
Here in Vienna, sir.
ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.
ESCALUS:
So. What trade are you of, sir?
POMPEY:
A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
ESCALUS:
Your mistress' name?
POMPEY:
Mistress Overdone.
ESCALUS:
Hath she had any more than one husband?
POMPEY:
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
ESCALUS:
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I
would not have you acquainted with tapsters: they will draw you,
Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me
hear no more of you.
FROTH:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into
any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.
ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth; farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master Tapster; what's your name, Master
Tapster?
POMPEY:
Pompey.
ESCALUS:
What else?
POMPEY:
Bum, sir.
ESCALUS:
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so
that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey,
you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a
tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better
for you.
POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you
think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?
POMPEY:
If the law would allow it, sir.
ESCALUS:
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be
allowed in Vienna.
POMPEY:
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
the city?
ESCALUS:
No, Pompey.
POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If
your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you
need not to fear the bawds.
ESCALUS:
There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it
is but heading and hanging.
POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more
heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest
house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come
to pass, say Pompey told you so.
ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy,
hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon
any complaint whatsoever- no, not for dwelling where you do; if I
do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt.
So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
POMPEY:
I thank your worship for your good counsel; but I
shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine.
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade;
The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade.
ESCALUS:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.
ESCALUS:
I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say seven years together?
ELBOW:
And a half, sir.
ESCALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong
to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward
sufficient to serve it?
ELBOW:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are
chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some
piece of money, and go through with all.
ESCALUS:
Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the
most sufficient of your parish.
ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?
ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'clock, think you?
JUSTICE:
Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS:
I pray you home to dinner with me.
JUSTICE:
I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.
JUSTICE:
Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.
But yet, poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
SERVANT:
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
I'll tell him of you.
PROVOST:
Pray you do. I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages, smack of this vice; and he
To die for 't!
ANGELO:
Now, what's the matter, Provost?
PROVOST:
Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
ANGELO:
Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?
PROVOST:
Lest I might be too rash;
Under your good correction, I have seen
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.
ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine.
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spar'd.
PROVOST:
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.
ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
SERVANT:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.
ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?
PROVOST:
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.
ANGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be remov'd;
Let her have needful but not lavish means;
There shall be order for't.
PROVOST:
[Going] Save your honour!
ANGELO:
Stay a little while. Y'are welcome; what's
your will?
ISABELLA:
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.
ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?
ISABELLA:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.
ANGELO:
Well; the matter?
ISABELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die;
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.
PROVOST:
[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done;
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.
ISABELLA:
O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him,
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
You are too cold: if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
To him, I say.
ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?
ANGELO:
Maiden, no remedy.
ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him.
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
ANGELO:
I will not do't.
ISABELLA:
But can you, if you would?
ANGELO:
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?
ANGELO:
He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
ISABELLA:
Too late? Why, no; I, that do speak a word,
May call it back again. Well, believe this:
No ceremony that to great ones longs,
Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you, and you as he,
You would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.
ANGELO:
Pray you be gone.
ISABELLA:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
And what a prisoner.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.
ISABELLA:
Alas! Alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.
ANGELO:
Be you content, fair maid.
It is the law, not I condemn your brother.
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.
ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.
LUCIO:
[Aside] Ay, well said.
ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
Those many had not dar'd to do that evil
If the first that did th' edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake,
Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass that shows what future evils-
Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But here they live to end.
ISABELLA:
Yet show some pity.
ANGELO:
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall,
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
ISABELLA:
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength! But it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] That's well said.
ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder,
Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,
Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,
Dress'd in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As makes the angels weep; who, with our speens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent;
He's coming; I perceive 't.
PROVOST:
[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
Great men may jest with saints: 'tis wit in them;
But in the less foul profanation.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
ISABELLA:
That in the captain's but a choleric word
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
ANGELO:
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
That skins the vice o' th' top. Go to your bosom,
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault. If it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.
ANGELO:
[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense that my sense breeds with it.- Fare you well.
ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.
ANGELO:
I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
ISABELLA:
Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
ANGELO:
How, bribe me?
ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
ISABELLA:
Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
Or stones, whose rate are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.
ANGELO:
Well; come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO:
[To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO:
[Aside] Amen; for I
Am that way going to temptation
Where prayers cross.
ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?
ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA:
Save your honour!
ANGELO:
From thee; even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flow'r,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary,
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
When men were fond, I smil'd and wond'red how.
DUKE:
Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
PROVOST:
I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
DUKE:
Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them, and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.
PROVOST:
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes one; a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report. She is with child;
And he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this.
DUKE:
When must he die?
PROVOST:
As I do think, to-morrow.
And you shall be conducted.
DUKE:
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
JULIET:
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
DUKE:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound
Or hollowly put on.
JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.
DUKE:
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
DUKE:
So then, it seems, your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed.
JULIET:
Mutually.
DUKE:
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
JULIET:
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
DUKE:
'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear-
JULIET:
I do repent me as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.
DUKE:
There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you! Benedicite!
JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O, injurious law,
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!
PROVOST:
'Tis pity of him.
ANGELO:
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name,
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception. The state whereon I studied
Is, like a good thing being often read,
Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
Let's write 'good angel' on the devil's horn;
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How now, who's there?
SERVANT:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
ANGELO:
Teach her the way. O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive; and even so
The general subject to a well-wish'd king
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
How now, fair maid?
ISABELLA:
I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO:
That you might know it would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
ISABELLA:
Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO:
Yet may he live awhile, and, it may be,
As long as you or I; yet he must die.
ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?
ANGELO:
Yea.
ISABELLA:
When? I beseech you; that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.
ANGELO:
Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.
ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
ANGELO:
Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather- that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?
ISABELLA:
Sir, believe this:
I had rather give my body than my soul.
ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.
ISABELLA:
How say you?
ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life;
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?
ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul
It is no sin at all, but charity.
ANGELO:
Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.
ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.
ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me;
Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant
Or seem so, craftily; and that's not good.
ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better.
ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me:
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross-
Your brother is to die.
ISABELLA:
So.
ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.
ISABELLA:
True.
ANGELO:
Admit no other way to save his life,
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desir'd of such a person
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-binding law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
What would you do?
ISABELLA:
As much for my poor brother as myself;
That is, were I under the terms of death,
Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
My body up to shame.
ANGELO:
Then must your brother die.
ISABELLA:
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.
ANGELO:
Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?
ISABELLA:
Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
ANGELO:
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.
ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord! It oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love.
ANGELO:
We are all frail.
ISABELLA:
Else let my brother die,
If not a fedary but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.
ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.
ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women, help heaven! Men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.
ANGELO:
I think it well;
And from this testimony of your own sex,
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold.
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now
By putting on the destin'd livery.
ISABELLA:
I have no tongue but one; gentle, my lord,
Let me intreat you speak the former language.
ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.
ISABELLA:
My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for't.
ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
ISABELLA:
I know your virtue hath a license in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.
ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.
ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be much believ'd,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for't.
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
Or, with an outstretch'd throat, I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.
ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, th' austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' th' state,
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report,
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can: my false o'erweighs your true.
ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue
Either of condemnation or approof,
Bidding the law make curtsy to their will;
Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother.
Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'd yield them up
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
DUKE:
So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.
DUKE:
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation where thou keep'st
Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nurs'd by baseness. Thou 'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exists on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.
CLAUDIO:
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life. Let it come on.
ISABELLA:
[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
PROVOST:
Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
DUKE:
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I thank you.
ISABELLA:
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
PROVOST:
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
DUKE:
Provost, a word with you.
PROVOST:
As many as you please.
DUKE:
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be conceal'd.
CLAUDIO:
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
Therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.
CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?
ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.
CLAUDIO:
But is there any?
ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.
CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?
ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determin'd scope.
CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?
ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.
CLAUDIO:
Let me know the point.
ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.
CLAUDIO:
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flow'ry tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms.
ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.
CLAUDIO:
The precise Angelo!
ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed?
CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.
ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.
CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt not do't.
ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life!
I'd throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.
CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.
ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he affections in him
That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;
Or of the deadly seven it is the least.
ISABELLA:
Which is the least?
CLAUDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel!
ISABELLA:
What says my brother?
CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.
ISABELLA:
And shamed life a hateful.
CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling- 'tis too horrible.
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.
ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live.
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.
ISABELLA:
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
Die; perish. Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.
CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.
ISABELLA:
O fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd;
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
CLAUDIO:
O, hear me, Isabella.
DUKE:
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
ISABELLA:
What is your will?
DUKE:
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have
some speech with you; the satisfaction I would require is
likewise your own benefit.
ISABELLA:
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen out
of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
DUKE:
Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your
sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath
made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;
therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your
resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;
go to your knees and make ready.
CLAUDIO:
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
that I will sue to be rid of it.
DUKE:
Hold you there. Farewell. Provost, a word with
you.
PROVOST:
What's your will, father?
DUKE:
That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while
with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
her by my company.
PROVOST:
In good time.
DUKE:
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness;
but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body
of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty
hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How
will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?
ISABELLA:
I am now going to resolve him; I had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how
much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo! If ever he return, and
I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his
government.
DUKE:
That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands,
he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love I have in
doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to
your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
business.
ISABELLA:
Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
DUKE:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not
heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great
soldier who miscarried at sea?
ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her
name.
DUKE:
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by
oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:
there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate
husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
ISABELLA:
Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
DUKE:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries
of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which
she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
washed with them, but relents not.
ISABELLA:
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man
live! But how out of this can she avail?
DUKE:
It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
doing it.
ISABELLA:
Show me how, good father.
DUKE:
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason should
have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current,
made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to
the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that
your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all
shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course- and now follows all: we shall
advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your
place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may
compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and
the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for
his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the
doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What
think you of it?
ISABELLA:
The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
DUKE:
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to
Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke's; there,
at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be
quickly.
ISABELLA:
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs
buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the
world drink brown and white bastard.
DUKE:
O heavens! what stuff is here?
POMPEY:
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest
was put down, and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd
gown to keep him warm; and furr'd with fox on lamb-skins too, to
signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the
facing.
ELBOW:
Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
DUKE:
And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made
you, sir?
ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him
to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a
strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.
DUKE:
Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice; say to thyself
'From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.'
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, sir,
I would prove-
DUKE:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer;
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.
ELBOW:
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning.
The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster; if he be a whoremonger,
and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.
DUKE:
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as his faults from seeming, free.
ELBOW:
His neck will come to your waist- a cord, sir.
POMPEY:
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend
of mine.
LUCIO:
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art
thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,
newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the
pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st
thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th'
last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was,
man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?
DUKE:
Still thus, and thus; still worse!
LUCIO:
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still,
ha?
POMPEY:
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is
herself in the tub.
LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever
your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd
consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?
POMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.
LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee
thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?
ELBOW:
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a
bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of
antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to
the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.
POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
LUCIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will
pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not
patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu trusty Pompey.
Bless you, friar.
DUKE:
And you.
LUCIO:
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.
POMPEY:
You will not bail me then, sir?
LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?
ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; come.
LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey, go.
What news, friar, of the Duke?
DUKE:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?
LUCIO:
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is
in Rome; but where is he, think you?
DUKE:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo
dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.
DUKE:
He does well in't.
LUCIO:
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him;
something too crabbed that way, friar.
DUKE:
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is
well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till
eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it
true, think you?
DUKE:
How should he be made, then?
LUCIO:
Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot
between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes
water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he
is a motion generative; that's infallible.
DUKE:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion
of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that
is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the
getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service,
and that instructed him to mercy.
DUKE:
I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was
not inclin'd that way.
LUCIO:
O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
DUKE:
'Tis not possible.
LUCIO:
Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use
was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in
him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.
DUKE:
You do him wrong, surely.
LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and
I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.
DUKE:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
LUCIO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth
and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file
of the subject held the Duke to be wise.
DUKE:
Wise? Why, no question but he was.
LUCIO:
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
DUKE:
Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very
stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a
warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but
testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to
the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you
speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much
dark'ned in your malice.
LUCIO:
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
DUKE:
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer
love.
LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I know.
DUKE:
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak.
But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me
desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you
have spoke, you have courage to maintain it; I am bound to call
upon you; and I pray you your name?
LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
DUKE:
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
LUCIO:
I fear you not.
DUKE:
O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me
too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm:
you'll forswear this again.
LUCIO:
I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no
more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?
DUKE:
Why should he die, sir?
LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke
we talk of were return'd again. This ungenitur'd agent will
unpeople the province with continency; sparrows must not build in
his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would
have dark deeds darkly answered; he would never bring them to
light. Would he were return'd! Marry, this Claudio is condemned
for untrussing. Farewell, good friar; I prithee pray for me. The
Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He's not
past it yet; and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar
though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so.
Farewell.
DUKE:
No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?
ESCALUS:
Go, away with her to prison.
MRS:
OVERDONE. Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is
accounted a merciful man; good my lord.
ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the
same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.
PROVOST:
A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your
honour.
MRS:
OVERDONE. My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke's time;
he promis'd her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old
come Philip and Jacob; I have kept it myself; and see how he goes
about to abuse me.
ESCALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be call'd
before us. Away with her to prison. Go to; no more words. [Exeunt
OFFICERS with MISTRESS OVERDONE]
not be alter'd: Claudio must die to-morrow. Let him be furnish'd
with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother
wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.
PROVOST:
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd
him for th' entertainment of death.
ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.
DUKE:
Bliss and goodness on you!
ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?
DUKE:
Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time. I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his Holiness.
ESCALUS:
What news abroad i' th' world?
DUKE:
None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and,
as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough
to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the
wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every
day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?
ESCALUS:
One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to
know himself.
DUKE:
What pleasure was he given to?
ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all
temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they
may prove prosperous; and let me desire to know how you find
Claudio prepar'd. I am made to understand that you have lent him
visitation.
DUKE:
He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his
frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good
leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.
ESCALUS:
You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner
the very debt of your calling. I have labour'd for the poor
gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother
justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.
DUKE:
If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it
shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath
sentenc'd himself.
ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
DUKE:
Peace be with you!
MARIANA:
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away;
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical.
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeas'd, but pleas'd my woe.
DUKE:
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
I pray you tell me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to-day. Much
upon this time have I promis'd here to meet.
MARIANA:
You have not been inquir'd after; I have sat here all day.
DUKE:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I
shall crave your forbearance a little. May be I will call upon
you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.
DUKE:
Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?
ISABELLA:
He hath a garden circummur'd with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key;
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads.
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.
DUKE:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't;
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.
DUKE:
Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' th' dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me; whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.
DUKE:
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.
I pray you be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.
ISABELLA:
I do desire the like.
DUKE:
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
MARIANA:
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
DUKE:
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure; but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.
MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?
DUKE:
O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee. Volumes of report
Run with these false, and most contrarious quest
Upon thy doings. Thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dream,
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?
ISABELLA:
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.
DUKE:
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.
ISABELLA:
Little have you to say,
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'
MARIANA:
Fear me not.
DUKE:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract.
To bring you thus together 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go;
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
PROVOST:
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
POMPEY:
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut of a
woman's head.
PROVOST:
Come, sir, leave me your snatches and yield me a direct
answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here
is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a
helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem
you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of
imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for
you have been a notorious bawd.
POMPEY:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; but yet
I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to
receive some instructions from my fellow partner.
PROVOST:
What ho, Abhorson! Where's Abhorson there?
ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?
PROVOST:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your
execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year,
and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present,
and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath
been a bawd.
ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.
PROVOST:
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn the
scale.
POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favour- for surely, sir, a good
favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call,
sir, your occupation a mystery?
ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a mystery.
POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your
whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do
prove my occupation a mystery; but what mystery there should be
in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine.
ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.
POMPEY:
Proof?
ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be too
little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it
be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough; so
every true man's apparel fits your thief.
PROVOST:
Are you agreed?
POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more
penitent trade than your bawd; he doth oftener ask forgiveness.
PROVOST:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe to-morrow
four o'clock.
ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
POMPEY:
I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion
to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare; for truly,
sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.
PROVOST:
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.
Th' one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death;
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones.
He will not wake.
PROVOST:
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself. But hark, what
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Welcome, father.
DUKE:
The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night
Envelop you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
PROVOST:
None, since the curfew rung.
DUKE:
Not Isabel?
PROVOST:
No.
DUKE:
They will then, ere't be long.
PROVOST:
What comfort is for Claudio?
DUKE:
There's some in hope.
PROVOST:
It is a bitter deputy.
DUKE:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice;
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r
To qualify in others. Were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just. Now are they
This is a gentle provost; seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How now, what noise! That spirit's possess'd with haste
That wounds th' unsisting postern with these strokes.
PROVOST:
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in; he is call'd up.
DUKE:
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
But he must die to-morrow?
PROVOST:
None, sir, none.
DUKE:
As near the dawning, Provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.
PROVOST:
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we.
Besides, upon the very siege of justice,
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
This is his lordship's man.
DUKE:
And here comes Claudio's pardon.
MESSENGER:
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further
charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it,
neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for
as I take it, it is almost day.
PROVOST:
I shall obey him.
DUKE:
[Aside] This is his pardon, purchas'd by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in;
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is borne in high authority.
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended
That for the fault's love is th' offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?
PROVOST:
I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine
office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks
strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.
DUKE:
Pray you, let's hear.
PROVOST:
[Reads] 'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and, in the afternoon,
Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio's
head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought
that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not
to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
What say you to this, sir?
DUKE:
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th'
afternoon?
PROVOST:
A Bohemian born; but here nurs'd up and bred.
One that is a prisoner nine years old.
DUKE:
How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him
to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his
manner to do so.
PROVOST:
His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed,
his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to
an undoubted proof.
DUKE:
It is now apparent?
PROVOST:
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
DUKE:
Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
be touch'd?
PROVOST:
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,
present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately
mortal.
DUKE:
He wants advice.
PROVOST:
He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many
times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft
awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a
seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.
DUKE:
More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost,
honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill
beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself
in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no
greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To
make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four
days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
a dangerous courtesy.
PROVOST:
Pray, sir, in what?
DUKE:
In the delaying death.
PROVOST:
Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an
express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view
of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
smallest.
DUKE:
By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions
may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
and his head borne to Angelo.
PROVOST:
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
DUKE:
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave
the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is
common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
it with my life.
PROVOST:
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
DUKE:
Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?
PROVOST:
To him and to his substitutes.
DUKE:
You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch
the justice of your dealing?
PROVOST:
But what likelihood is in that?
DUKE:
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you
fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can
with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck
all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of
the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is
not strange to you.
PROVOST:
I know them both.
DUKE:
The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall
anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within
these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows
not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'
unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into
amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but
easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with
Barnardine's head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise
him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall
absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
profession; one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own
house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here's young
Master Rash; he's in for a commodity of brown paper and old
ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds, of which he made five
marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request,
for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master
Caper, at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer, for some four
suits of peach-colour'd satin, which now peaches him a beggar.
Then have we here young Dizy, and young Master Deepvow, and
Master Copperspur, and Master Starvelackey, the rapier and dagger
man, and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shootie the great
traveller, and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots, and, I think,
forty more- all great doers in our trade, and are now 'for the
Lord's sake.'
ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hang'd, Master
Barnardine!
ABHORSON:
What ho, Barnardine!
BARNARDINE:
[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
there? What are you?
POMPEY:
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir,
to rise and be put to death.
BARNARDINE:
[ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.
ABHORSON:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
POMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and
sleep afterwards.
ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
ABHORSON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
POMPEY:
Very ready, sir.
BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?
ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers;
for, look you, the warrant's come.
BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for't.
POMPEY:
O, the better, sir! For he that drinks all night and is
hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next
day.
ABHORSON:
Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father.
Do we jest now, think you?
DUKE:
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are
to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with
you.
BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night, and
I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my
brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that's
certain.
DUKE:
O, Sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.
BARNARDINE:
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.
DUKE:
But hear you-
BARNARDINE:
Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to
my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
DUKE:
Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
PROVOST:
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
DUKE:
A creature unprepar'd, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.
PROVOST:
Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclin'd,
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
DUKE:
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo. See this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
PROVOST:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon;
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?
DUKE:
Let this be done:
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio.
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.
PROVOST:
I am your free dependant.
DUKE:
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo-
The Provost, he shall bear them- whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly. Him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount,
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanc'd form.
We shall proceed with Angelo.
PROVOST:
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
DUKE:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.
PROVOST:
I'll make all speed.
ISABELLA:
[ Within ] Peace, ho, be here!
DUKE:
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither;
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected.
ISABELLA:
Ho, by your leave!
DUKE:
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
DUKE:
He hath releas'd him, Isabel, from the world.
His head is off and sent to Angelo.
ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so.
DUKE:
It is no other.
Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience,
ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
DUKE:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.
ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!
DUKE:
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity.
The Duke comes home to-morrow. Nay, dry your eyes.
One of our covent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their pow'r. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart,
And general honour.
ISABELLA:
I am directed by you.
DUKE:
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal; and he shall bring you
Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow,
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
LUCIO:
Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?
DUKE:
Not within, sir.
LUCIO:
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with
water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one
fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be
here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the
old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had
lived.
DUKE:
Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports;
but the best is, he lives not in them.
LUCIO:
Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a
better woodman than thou tak'st him for.
DUKE:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
LUCIO:
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty
tales of the Duke.
DUKE:
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be
true; if not true, none were enough.
LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
DUKE:
Did you such a thing?
LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would
else have married me to the rotten medlar.
DUKE:
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
LUCIO:
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end. If bawdy
talk offend you, we'll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a
kind of burr; I shall stick.
ESCALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other.
ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
like to madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted! And why
meet him at the gates, and redeliver our authorities there?
ESCALUS:
I guess not.
ANGELO:
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should
exhibit their petitions in the street?
ESCALUS:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
shall then have no power to stand against us.
ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaim'd;
Betimes i' th' morn I'll call you at your house;
Give notice to such men of sort and suit
As are to meet him.
ESCALUS:
I shall, sir; fare you well.
ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflow'red maid!
And by an eminent body that enforc'd
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears a so credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have liv'd,
Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had liv'd!
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.
DUKE:
These letters at fit time deliver me.
The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
As cause doth minister. Go, call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.
PETER. It shall be speeded well.
DUKE:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste.
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius!
ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath;
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part. Yet I am advis'd to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.
MARIANA:
Be rul'd by him.
ISABELLA:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.
MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter-
ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.
PETER:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is ent'ring; therefore, hence, away.
DUKE:
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
DUKE:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you, and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.
ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.
DUKE:
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand,
And good supporters are you.
PETER:
Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.
ISABELLA:
Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid!
O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint,
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.
DUKE:
Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice;
Reveal yourself to him.
ISABELLA:
O worthy Duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil!
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believ'd,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O, hear me, here!
ANGELO:
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother,
Cut off by course of justice-
ISABELLA:
By course of justice!
ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak.
That Angelo's forsworn, is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer, is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
Is it not strange and strange?
DUKE:
Nay, it is ten times strange.
ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange;
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To th' end of reck'ning.
DUKE:
Away with her. Poor soul,
She speaks this in th' infirmity of sense.
ISABELLA:
O Prince! I conjure thee, as thou believ'st
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness. Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute,
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince,
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.
DUKE:
By mine honesty,
If she be mad, as I believe no other,
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.
ISABELLA:
O gracious Duke,
Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.
DUKE:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
ISABELLA:
I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo.
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger-
LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your Grace.
I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.
ISABELLA:
That's he, indeed.
DUKE:
You were not bid to speak.
LUCIO:
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
DUKE:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you take note of it; and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.
LUCIO:
I warrant your honour.
DUKE:
The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.
ISABELLA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
LUCIO:
Right.
DUKE:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.
ISABELLA:
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy.
DUKE:
That's somewhat madly spoken.
ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.
DUKE:
Mended again. The matter- proceed.
ISABELLA:
In brief- to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,
For this was of much length- the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.
DUKE:
This is most likely!
ISABELLA:
O that it were as like as it is true!
DUKE:
By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou cam'st here to complain.
ISABELLA:
And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
DUKE:
I know you'd fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?
ISABELLA:
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
DUKE:
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
LUCIO:
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar.
I do not like the man; had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your Grace
In your retirement, I had swing'd him soundly.
DUKE:
Words against me? This's a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
LUCIO:
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.
PETER:
Blessed be your royal Grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abus'd. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute;
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.
DUKE:
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
PETER:
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.
LUCIO:
My lord, most villainously; believe it.
PETER:
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request-
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he, with his oath
And all probation, will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman-
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accus'd-
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.
DUKE:
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause.
Is this the witness, friar?
MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.
DUKE:
What, are you married?
MARIANA:
No, my lord.
DUKE:
Are you a maid?
MARIANA:
No, my lord.
DUKE:
A widow, then?
MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.
DUKE:
Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.
LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither
maid, widow, nor wife.
DUKE:
Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.
LUCIO:
Well, my lord.
MARIANA:
My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,
And I confess, besides, I am no maid.
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.
LUCIO:
He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.
DUKE:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
LUCIO:
Well, my lord.
DUKE:
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
MARIANA:
Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband;
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms,
With all th' effect of love.
ANGELO:
Charges she moe than me?
MARIANA:
Not that I know.
DUKE:
No? You say your husband.
MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
ANGELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
MARIANA:
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagin'd person.
DUKE:
Know you this woman?
LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.
DUKE:
Sirrah, no more.
LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.
ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition; but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity. Since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.
MARIANA:
Noble Prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianc'd this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows. And, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone, in's garden-house,
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees,
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!
ANGELO:
I did but smile till now.
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,
To find this practice out.
DUKE:
Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit,
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis deriv'd.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.
PETER:
Would lie were here, my lord! For he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint.
Your provost knows the place where he abides,
And he may fetch him.
DUKE:
Go, do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best
In any chastisement. I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determin'd
Upon these slanderers.
ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be
a dishonest person?
LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum': honest in nothing but in his
clothes; and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
Duke.
ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable
fellow.
LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.
ESCALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with
her. Pray you, my lord, give me leave to
question; you shall see how I'll handle her.
LUCIO:
Not better than he, by her own report.
ESCALUS:
Say you?
LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would
sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.
ESCALUS:
I will go darkly to work with her.
LUCIO:
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
ESCALUS:
Come on, mistress; here's a gentlewoman denies all that
you have said.
LUCIO:
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the
Provost.
ESCALUS:
In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon
you.
LUCIO:
Mum.
ESCALUS:
Come, sir; did you set these women on to slander Lord
Angelo? They have confess'd you did.
DUKE:
'Tis false.
ESCALUS:
How! Know you where you are?
DUKE:
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak.
ESCALUS:
The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak;
Look you speak justly.
DUKE:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox,
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.
LUCIO:
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
ESCALUS:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth,
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain; and then to glance from him
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What, 'unjust'!
DUKE:
Be not so hot; the Duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own; his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker-on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.
ESCALUS:
Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison!
ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, good-man bald-pate.
Do you know me?
DUKE:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at
the prison, in the absence of the Duke.
LUCIO:
O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?
DUKE:
Most notedly, sir.
LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and
a coward, as you then reported him to be?
DUKE:
You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my
report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse.
LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for
thy speeches?
DUKE:
I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.
ANGELO:
Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable
abuses!
ESCALUS:
Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal. Away with him to
prison! Where is the Provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts
enough upon him; let him speak no more. Away with those giglets
too, and with the other confederate companion!
DUKE:
Stay, sir; stay awhile.
ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your
knave's visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face,
and be hang'd an hour! Will't not off?
DUKE:
Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke.
First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
LUCIO:
This may prove worse than hanging.
DUKE:
[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down.
We'll borrow place of him. Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.
ANGELO:
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession;
Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
Is all the grace I beg.
DUKE:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
ANGELO:
I was, my lord.
DUKE:
Go, take her hence and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, Provost.
ESCALUS:
My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.
DUKE:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince. As I was then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.
ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty.
DUKE:
You are pardon'd, Isabel.
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.
ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.
DUKE:
For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well-defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-
Being criminal in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach,
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!
MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
DUKE:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life,
And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband.
MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.
DUKE:
Never crave him; we are definitive.
MARIANA:
Gentle my liege-
DUKE:
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death! Now, sir, to you.
MARIANA:
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
DUKE:
Against all sense you do importune her.
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.
MARIANA:
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say best men moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad; so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
DUKE:
He dies for Claudio's death.
ISABELLA:
[Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
Till he did look on me; since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died;
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.
MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.
DUKE:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?
PROVOST:
It was commanded so.
DUKE:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
PROVOST:
No, my good lord; it was by private message.
DUKE:
For which I do discharge you of your office;
Give up your keys.
PROVOST:
Pardon me, noble lord;
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserv'd alive.
DUKE:
What's he?
PROVOST:
His name is Barnardine.
DUKE:
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
ESCALUS:
I am sorry one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
DUKE:
Which is that Barnardine?
PROVOST:
This, my lord.
DUKE:
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd;
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffl'd fellow's that?
PROVOST:
This is another prisoner that I sav'd,
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
DUKE:
[To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well.
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
To Lucio] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman!
Wherein have I so deserv'd of you
That you extol me thus?
LUCIO:
Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick.
If you will hang me for it, you may; but I had rather it would
please you I might be whipt.
DUKE:
Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after.
Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city,
If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow-
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.
LUCIO:
I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your
Highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold.
DUKE:
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.
LUCIO:
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,
and hanging.
DUKE:
Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo;
I have confess'd her, and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness;
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy;
We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
Th' offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace, where we'll show
What's yet behind that's meet you all should know.
ANTONIO:
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
That I have much ado to know myself.
SALERIO:
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There where your argosies, with portly sail-
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or as it were the pageants of the sea-
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SOLANIO:
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,
Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,
Would make me sad.
SALERIO:
My wind, cooling my broth,
Would blow me to an ague when I thought
What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which, touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
ANTONIO:
Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year;
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
SOLANIO:
Why then you are in love.
ANTONIO:
Fie, fie!
SOLANIO:
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
Because you are not merry; and 'twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;
We leave you now with better company.
SALERIO:
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO:
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it your own business calls on you,
And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
SALERIO:
Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO:
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.
You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?
SALERIO:
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
LORENZO:
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
BASSANIO:
I will not fail you.
GRATIANO:
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world;
They lose it that do buy it with much care.
Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.
ANTONIO:
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
A stage, where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.
GRATIANO:
Let me play the fool.
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,
Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-
I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks-
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time.
But fish not with this melancholy bait
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile;
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
LORENZO:
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO:
Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
ANTONIO:
Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
GRATIANO:
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.
ANTONIO:
Is that anything now?
BASSANIO:
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find
them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.
ANTONIO:
Well; tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?
BASSANIO:
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance;
Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love;
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
ANTONIO:
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
BASSANIO:
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way, with more advised watch,
To find the other forth; and by adventuring both
I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
ANTONIO:
You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have.
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.
BASSANIO:
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
And she is fair and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages.
Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift
That I should questionless be fortunate.
ANTONIO:
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,
Try what my credit can in Venice do;
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.
Go presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is; and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
PORTIA:
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this
great world.
NERISSA:
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I
see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be
seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.
PORTIA:
Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
NERISSA:
They would be better, if well followed.
PORTIA:
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,
chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes'
palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I
can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one
of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise
laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree;
such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good
counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose'! I may neither
choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a
living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father. Is it not
hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
NERISSA:
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath
devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof
who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be
chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But
what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these
princely suitors that are already come?
PORTIA:
I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will
describe them; and according to my description, level at my
affection.
NERISSA:
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
PORTIA:
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good
parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my lady his
mother play'd false with a smith.
NERISSA:
Then is there the County Palatine.
PORTIA:
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will
not have me, choose.' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear
he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so
full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married
to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of
these. God defend me from these two!
NERISSA:
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
PORTIA:
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he hath a
horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of
frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a
throstle sing he falls straight a-cap'ring; he will fence with
his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty
husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he
love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
NERISSA:
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of
England?
PORTIA:
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me,
nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you
will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth
in the English. He is a proper man's picture; but alas, who can
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he
bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet
in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.
NERISSA:
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
PORTIA:
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed
a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him
again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety,
and seal'd under for another.
NERISSA:
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
nephew?
PORTIA:
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most
vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is best, he is
a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little
better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I
shall make shift to go without him.
NERISSA:
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should
refuse to accept him.
PORTIA:
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep
glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the devil be
within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I
will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
NERISSA:
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords;
they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is
indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more
suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition, depending on the caskets.
PORTIA:
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will. I
am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is not
one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God
grant them a fair departure.
NERISSA:
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of
the Marquis of Montferrat?
PORTIA:
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
NERISSA:
True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
PORTIA:
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
praise.
How now! what news?
SERVINGMAN:
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of
Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here
to-night.
PORTIA:
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his
approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion
of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats- well.
BASSANIO:
Ay, sir, for three months.
SHYLOCK:
For three months- well.
BASSANIO:
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
SHYLOCK:
Antonio shall become bound- well.
BASSANIO:
May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your
answer?
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
BASSANIO:
Your answer to that.
SHYLOCK:
Antonio is a good man.
BASSANIO:
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
SHYLOCK:
Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man
is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his means
are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another
to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a
third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he
hath, squand'red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but
men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and
land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of
waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond.
BASSANIO:
Be assur'd you may.
SHYLOCK:
I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I
will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
BASSANIO:
If it please you to dine with us.
SHYLOCK:
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your
prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I will buy with
you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so
following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray
with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
BASSANIO:
This is Signior Antonio.
SHYLOCK:
[Aside]
I hate him for he is a Christian;
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis, and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe
If I forgive him!
BASSANIO:
Shylock, do you hear?
SHYLOCK:
I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire? Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
ANTONIO:
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?
SHYLOCK:
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
ANTONIO:
And for three months.
SHYLOCK:
I had forgot- three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and, let me see- but hear you,
Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.
ANTONIO:
I do never use it.
SHYLOCK:
When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep-
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third-
ANTONIO:
And what of him? Did he take interest?
SHYLOCK:
No, not take interest; not, as you would say,
Directly int'rest; mark what Jacob did:
When Laban and himself were compromis'd
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In end of autumn turned to the rams;
And when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands,
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
ANTONIO:
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
SHYLOCK:
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
But note me, signior.
ANTONIO:
[Aside]
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
SHYLOCK:
Three thousand ducats- 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then let me see, the rate-
ANTONIO:
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
SHYLOCK:
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances;
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe;
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help;
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys.' You say so-
You that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? Is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and, in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness,
Say this:
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last,
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
ANTONIO:
I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends- for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who if he break thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.
SHYLOCK:
Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you, and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants, and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me.
This is kind I offer.
BASSANIO:
This were kindness.
SHYLOCK:
This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond, and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
ANTONIO:
Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
BASSANIO:
You shall not seal to such a bond for me;
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
ANTONIO:
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
Within these two months- that's a month before
This bond expires- I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
SHYLOCK:
O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this:
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
ANTONIO:
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
SHYLOCK:
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I'll be with you.
ANTONIO:
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
BASSANIO:
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
ANTONIO:
Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO:
Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun,
To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear'd the valiant; by my love, I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have lov'd it too. I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
PORTIA:
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides, the lott'ry of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
But, if my father had not scanted me,
And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO:
Even for that I thank you.
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune. By this scimitar,
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look,
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when 'a roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker band.
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.
PORTIA:
You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all,
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong,
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage; therefore be advis'd.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO:
Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
PORTIA:
First, forward to the temple. After dinner
Your hazard shall be made.
PRINCE OF MOROCCO:
Good fortune then,
To make me blest or cursed'st among men!
LAUNCELOT:
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying
to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot' or 'good Gobbo' or
'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.'
My conscience says 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed,
honest Gobbo' or, as aforesaid, 'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not
run; scorn running with thy heels.' Well, the most courageous
fiend bids me pack. 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
fiend. 'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind' says the fiend
'and run.' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my
heart, says very wisely to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being
an honest man's son' or rather 'an honest woman's son'; for
indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a
kind of taste- well, my conscience says 'Launcelot, budge not.'
'Budge,' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, (you counsel well.' 'Fiend,' say I, 'you
counsel well.' To be rul'd by my conscience, I should stay with
the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil;
and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the
Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my
conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly
counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I
will run.
GOBBO:
Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to
master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT:
[Aside]
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.
I will try confusions with him.
GOBBO:
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to
master Jew's?
LAUNCELOT:
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at
the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next
turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's
house.
GOBBO:
Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell
me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or
no?
LAUNCELOT:
Talk you of young Master Launcelot? Mark me
now; now will I raise the waters.- Talk you of young Master
Launcelot?
GOBBO:
No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I
say't, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well
to live.
LAUNCELOT:
Well, let his father be what 'a will, we talk of young
Master Launcelot.
GOBBO:
Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
LAUNCELOT:
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk
you of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO:
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
LAUNCELOT:
Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot,
father; for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies
and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
learning, is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain
terms, gone to heaven.
GOBBO:
Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my
very prop.
LAUNCELOT:
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a
prop? Do you know me, father?
GOBBO:
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray
you tell me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead?
LAUNCELOT:
Do you not know me, father?
GOBBO:
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
LAUNCELOT:
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the
knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well,
old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing;
truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
may, but in the end
SHALLOW:
Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star
Chamber matter of it; if he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs,
he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.
SLENDER:
In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace, and
Coram.
SHALLOW:
Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum.
SLENDER:
Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born,
Master Parson, who writes himself 'Armigero' in any bill,
warrant, quittance, or obligation-'Armigero.'
SHALLOW:
Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
hundred years.
SLENDER:
All his successors, gone before him, hath done't;
and all his ancestors, that come after him, may: they may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.
SHALLOW:
It is an old coat.
EVANS:
The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and
signifies love.
SHALLOW:
The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old
coat.
SLENDER:
I may quarter, coz.
SHALLOW:
You may, by marrying.
EVANS:
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
SHALLOW:
Not a whit.
EVANS:
Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there
is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures;
but that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed
disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be
glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements and
compremises between you.
SHALLOW:
The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.
EVANS:
It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no
fear of Got in a riot; the Council, look you, shall desire
to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your
vizaments in that.
SHALLOW:
Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
should end it.
EVANS:
It is petter that friends is the sword and end it;
and there is also another device in my prain, which
peradventure prings goot discretions with it. There is Anne
Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is
pretty virginity.
SLENDER:
Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and
speaks small like a woman.
EVANS:
It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you
will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and
gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death's-bed-Got
deliver to a joyful resurrections!-give, when she is able to
overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we
leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage
between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
SHALLOW:
Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
EVANS:
Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
SHALLOW:
I know the young gentlewoman; she has good
gifts.
EVANS:
Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.
SHALLOW:
Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
there?
EVANS:
Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
despise one that is false; or as I despise one that is not
true. The knight Sir John is there; and, I beseech you, be
ruled by your well-willers. I will peat the door for Master
Page.
PAGE:
[Within]
EVANS:
Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
shall tell you another tale, if matters grow to your
likings.
PAGE:
I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for
my venison, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW:
Master Page, I am glad to see you; much good do
it your good heart! I wish'd your venison better; it was ill
kill'd. How doth good Mistress Page?-and I thank you
always with my heart, la! with my heart.
PAGE:
Sir, I thank you.
SHALLOW:
Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
PAGE:
I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
SLENDER:
How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say
he was outrun on Cotsall.
PAGE:
It could not be judg'd, sir.
SLENDER:
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
SHALLOW:
That he will not. 'Tis your fault; 'tis your fault;
'tis a good dog.
PAGE:
A cur, sir.
SHALLOW:
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog. Can there be
more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?
PAGE:
Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office
between you.
EVANS:
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
SHALLOW:
He hath wrong'd me, Master Page.
PAGE:
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
SHALLOW:
If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that
so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; indeed he hath; at a
word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith
he is wronged.
PAGE:
Here comes Sir John.
FALSTAFF:
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to
the King?
SHALLOW:
Knight, you have beaten my men, kill'd my deer,
and broke open my lodge.
FALSTAFF:
But not kiss'd your keeper's daughter.
SHALLOW:
Tut, a pin! this shall be answer'd.
FALSTAFF:
I will answer it straight: I have done all this.
That is now answer'd.
SHALLOW:
The Council shall know this.
FALSTAFF:
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
you'll be laugh'd at.
EVANS:
Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
FALSTAFF:
Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your
head; what matter have you against me?
SLENDER:
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym,
and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern, and made me
drunk, and afterwards pick'd my pocket.
BARDOLPH:
You Banbury cheese!
SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.
PISTOL:
How now, Mephostophilus!
SLENDER:
Ay, it is no matter.
NYM:
Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.
SLENDER:
Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
EVANS:
Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is,
Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is myself,
fidelicet myself; and the three party is, lastly and
finally, mine host of the Garter.
PAGE:
We three to hear it and end it between them.
EVANS:
Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my note-book;
and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great
discreetly as we can.
FALSTAFF:
Pistol!
PISTOL:
He hears with ears.
EVANS:
The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, 'He hears
with ear'? Why, it is affectations.
FALSTAFF:
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
SLENDER:
Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might
never come in mine own great chamber again else!-of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece
of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
FALSTAFF:
Is this true, Pistol?
EVANS:
No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
PISTOL:
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and master
mine,
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.
SLENDER:
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
NYM:
Be avis'd, sir, and pass good humours; I will say
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's humour on
me; that is the very note of it.
SLENDER:
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
FALSTAFF:
What say you, Scarlet and John?
BARDOLPH:
Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had
drunk himself out of his five sentences.
EVANS:
It is his five senses; fie, what the ignorance is!
BARDOLPH:
And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd;
and so conclusions pass'd the careers.
SLENDER:
Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no matter;
I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest,
civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I'll be
drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with
drunken knaves.
EVANS:
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
FALSTAFF:
You hear all these matters deni'd, gentlemen; you
hear it.
PAGE:
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
SLENDER:
O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
PAGE:
How now, Mistress Ford!
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well
met; by your leave, good mistress.
PAGE:
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
hot venison pasty to dinner; come, gentlemen, I hope we
shall drink down all unkindness.
SLENDER:
I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
Songs and Sonnets here.
How, Simple! Where have you been? I must wait on
myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles about you,
have you?
SIMPLE:
Book of Riddles! Why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore
Michaelmas?
SHALLOW:
Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do
you understand me?
SLENDER:
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I
shall do that that is reason.
SHALLOW:
Nay, but understand me.
SLENDER:
So I do, sir.
EVANS:
Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
SLENDER:
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says; I pray
you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country,
simple though I stand here.
EVANS:
But that is not the question. The question is
concerning your marriage.
SHALLOW:
Ay, there's the point, sir.
EVANS:
Marry is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne
Page.
SLENDER:
Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.
EVANS:
But can you affection the oman? Let us command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers
hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore,
precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?
SHALLOW:
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
SLENDER:
I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would do reason.
EVANS:
Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable,
if you can carry her your desires towards her.
SHALLOW:
That you must. Will you, upon good dowry,
marry her?
SLENDER:
I will do a greater thing than that upon your request,
cousin, in any reason.
SHALLOW:
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what
I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
SLENDER:
I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease
it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and
have more occasion to know one another. I hope upon
familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say
'marry her,' I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved,
and dissolutely.
EVANS:
It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the
ord 'dissolutely': the ort is, according to our meaning,
'resolutely'; his meaning is good.
SHALLOW:
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
SLENDER:
Ay, or else I would I might be hang'd, la!
SHALLOW:
Here comes fair Mistress Anne. Would I were
young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
ANNE:
The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.
SHALLOW:
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne!
EVANS:
Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
ANNE:
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
SLENDER:
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very
well.
ANNE:
The dinner attends you, sir.
SLENDER:
I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin
SHALLOW:
[Exit SIMPLE]
be beholding to his friend for a man. I keep but three men
and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what though?
Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.
ANNE:
I may not go in without your worship; they will not
sit till you come.
SLENDER:
I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
though I did.
ANNE:
I pray you, sir, walk in.
SLENDER:
I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruis'd my
shin th' other day with playing at sword and dagger with
a master of fence-three veneys for a dish of stew'd prunes
and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat
since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i' th'
town?
ANNE:
I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of.
SLENDER:
I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the
bear loose, are you not?
ANNE:
Ay, indeed, sir.
SLENDER:
That's meat and drink to me now. I have seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the
chain; but I warrant you, the women have so cried and
shriek'd at it that it pass'd; but women, indeed, cannot
abide 'em; they are very ill-favour'd rough things.
PAGE:
Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
SLENDER:
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
PAGE:
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come,
come.
SLENDER:
Nay, pray you lead the way.
PAGE:
Come on, sir.
SLENDER:
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
ANNE:
Not I, sir; pray you keep on.
SLENDER:
Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do
you that wrong.
ANNE:
I pray you, sir.
SLENDER:
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You
do yourself wrong indeed, la!
EVANS:
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
is the way; and there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which
is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his cook,
or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer.
SIMPLE:
Well, sir.
EVANS:
Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it is a
oman that altogether's acquaintance with Mistress Anne
Page; and the letter is to desire and require her to solicit
your master's desires to Mistress Anne Page. I pray you
be gone. I will make an end of my dinner; there's pippins
and cheese to come.
FALSTAFF:
Mine host of the Garter!
HOST:
What says my bully rook? Speak scholarly and
wisely.
FALSTAFF:
Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.
HOST:
Discard, bully Hercules; cashier; let them wag; trot,
trot.
FALSTAFF:
I sit at ten pounds a week.
HOST:
Thou'rt an emperor-Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I
will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall tap; said I
well, bully Hector?
FALSTAFF:
Do so, good mine host.
HOST:
I have spoke; let him follow. Let me
see thee froth and lime. I am at a word; follow.
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade;
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a wither'd serving-man a
fresh tapster. Go; adieu.
BARDOLPH:
It is a life that I have desir'd; I will thrive.
PISTOL:
O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot
wield?
NYM:
He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?
FALSTAFF:
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an unskilful
singer-he kept not time.
NYM:
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
PISTOL:
'Convey' the wise it call. 'Steal' foh! A fico for the
phrase!
FALSTAFF:
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
PISTOL:
Why, then, let kibes ensue.
FALSTAFF:
There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must
shift.
PISTOL:
Young ravens must have food.
FALSTAFF:
Which of you know Ford of this town?
PISTOL:
I ken the wight; he is of substance good.
FALSTAFF:
My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
PISTOL:
Two yards, and more.
FALSTAFF:
No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist
two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's wife; I
spy entertainment in her; she discourses, she carves, she
gives the leer of invitation; I can construe the action of her
familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be
English'd rightly, is 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
PISTOL. He hath studied her well, and translated her will out
of honesty into English.
NYM:
The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?
FALSTAFF:
Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse; he hath a legion of angels.
PISTOL:
As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
NYM:
The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.
FALSTAFF:
I have writ me here a letter to her; and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good eyes
too, examin'd my parts with most judicious oeillades;
sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my
portly belly.
PISTOL:
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
NYM:
I thank thee for that humour.
FALSTAFF:
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such
a greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did seem to
scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's another letter to
her. She bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana, all
gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and they
shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this
letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford. We
will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
PISTOL:
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!
NYM:
I will run no base humour. Here, take the
humour-letter; I will keep the haviour of reputation.
FALSTAFF:
[To ROBIN]
tightly;
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
Trudge, plod away i' th' hoof; seek shelter, pack!
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age;
French thrift, you rogues; myself, and skirted page.
PISTOL:
Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam
holds,
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor;
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
Base Phrygian Turk!
NYM:
I have operations in my head which be humours of
revenge.
PISTOL:
Wilt thou revenge?
NYM:
By welkin and her star!
PISTOL:
With wit or steel?
NYM:
With both the humours, I.
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
PISTOL:
And I to Ford shall eke unfold
How Falstaff, varlet vile,
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.
NYM:
My humour shall not cool; I will incense Page to deal
with poison; I will possess him with yellowness; for the
revolt of mine is dangerous. That is my true humour.
PISTOL:
Thou art the Mars of malcontents; I second thee;
troop on.
QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby! I pray thee go to the casement
and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the
house, here will be an old abusing of God's patience and
the King's English.
RUGBY:
I'll go watch.
QUICKLY:
Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire. An
honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in
house withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no
breed-bate; his worst fault is that he is given to prayer; he is
something peevish that way; but nobody but has his fault;
but let that pass. Peter Simple you say your name is?
SIMPLE:
Ay, for fault of a better.
QUICKLY:
And Master Slender's your master?
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth.
QUICKLY:
Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
glover's paring-knife?
SIMPLE:
No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a
little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.
QUICKLY:
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as
any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a
warrener.
QUICKLY:
How say you? O, I should remember him. Does
he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
SIMPLE:
Yes, indeed, does he.
QUICKLY:
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!
Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
master. Anne is a good girl, and I wish-
RUGBY:
Out, alas! here comes my master.
QUICKLY:
We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young
man; go into this closet. He
will not stay long. What, John Rugby! John! what, John,
I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt he be
not well that he comes not home.
And down, down, adown-a, etc.
CAIUS:
Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you, go
and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert-a box, a green-a
box. Do intend vat I speak? A green-a box.
QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth, I'll fetch it you. I am glad
he went not in himself; if he had found the young man,
he would have been horn-mad.
CAIUS:
Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m'en vais a
la cour-la grande affaire.
QUICKLY:
Is it this, sir?
CAIUS:
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
is dat knave, Rugby?
QUICKLY:
What, John Rugby? John!
RUGBY:
Here, sir.
CAIUS:
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.
Come, take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the
court.
RUGBY:
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
CAIUS. By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me! Qu'ai j'oublie?
Dere is some simples in my closet dat I vill not for the
varld I shall leave behind.
QUICKLY:
Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be
mad!
CAIUS:
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villainy! larron!
QUICKLY:
Good master, be content.
CAIUS:
Wherefore shall I be content-a?
QUICKLY:
The young man is an honest man.
CAIUS:
What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is
no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
QUICKLY:
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic; hear the
truth of it. He came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
CAIUS:
Vell?
SIMPLE:
Ay, forsooth, to desire her to-
QUICKLY:
Peace, I pray you.
CAIUS:
Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
SIMPLE:
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master,
in the way of marriage.
QUICKLY:
This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my finger
in the fire, and need not.
CAIUS:
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baillez me some paper.
Tarry you a little-a-while.
QUICKLY:
[Aside to SIMPLE]
had been throughly moved, you should have heard him
so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I'll
do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and
the no is, the French doctor, my master-I may call him
my master, look you, for I keep his house; and I wash,
wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the
beds, and do all myself-
SIMPLE:
[Aside to QUICKLY]
under one body's hand.
QUICKLY:
[Aside to SIMPLE]
shall find it a great charge; and to be up early and down
late; but notwithstanding-to tell you in your ear, I would
have no words of it-my master himself is in love with
Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know
Anne's mind-that's neither here nor there.
CAIUS:
You jack'nape; give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by gar,
it is a shallenge; I will cut his troat in de park; and I will
teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You
may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. By gar, I will
cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone
to throw at his dog.
QUICKLY:
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
CAIUS:
It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I
shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack
priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to
measure our weapon. By gar, I will myself have Anne
Page.
QUICKLY:
Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
must give folks leave to prate. What the good-year!
CAIUS:
Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.
Follow my heels, Rugby.
QUICKLY:
You shall have-An fool's-head of your own. No,
I know Anne's mind for that; never a woman in Windsor
knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
than I do with her, I thank heaven.
FENTON:
[Within]
QUICKLY:
Who's there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray
you.
FENTON:
How now, good woman, how dost thou?
QUICKLY:
The better that it pleases your good worship to
ask.
FENTON:
What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?
QUICKLY:
In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by
the way; I praise heaven for it.
FENTON:
Shall I do any good, think'st thou? Shall I not lose
my suit?
QUICKLY:
Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but
notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book
she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?
FENTON:
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
QUICKLY:
Well, thereby hangs a tale; good faith, it is such
another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke
bread. We had an hour's talk of that wart; I shall never
laugh but in that maid's company! But, indeed, she is
given too much to allicholy and musing; but for you-well,
go to.
FENTON:
Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest
her before me, commend me.
QUICKLY:
Will I? I' faith, that we will; and I will tell your
worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence;
and of other wooers.
FENTON:
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.
QUICKLY:
Farewell to your worship. Truly,
an honest gentleman; but Anne loves him not; for I know
Anne's mind as well as another does. Out upon 't, what
have I forgot?
MRS:
PAGE. What! have I scap'd love-letters in the holiday-time
of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let
me see.
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use
Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor.
You are not young, no more am I; go to, then, there's
sympathy. You are merry, so am I; ha! ha! then there's
more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I; would you
desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page
at the least, if the love of soldier can suffice-that I love
thee. I will not say, Pity me: 'tis not a soldier-like phrase;
but I say, Love me. By me,
Thine own true knight,
By day or night,
Or any kind of light,
With all his might,
For thee to fight,
JOHN FALSTAFF.'
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world!
One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show
himself a young gallant! What an unweighed behaviour
hath this Flemish drunkard pick'd-with the devil's name!
assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!
What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth.
Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill in the parliament
for the putting down of men. How shall I be
reveng'd on him? for reveng'd I will be, as sure as his guts
are made of puddings.
MRS:
FORD. Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your
house.
MRS:
PAGE. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look
very ill.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to
the contrary.
MRS:
PAGE. Faith, but you do, in my mind.
MRS:
FORD. Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to
the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel.
MRS:
PAGE. What's the matter, woman?
MRS:
FORD. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect,
I could come to such honour!
MRS:
PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What
is it? Dispense with trifles; what is it?
MRS:
FORD. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment
or so, I could be knighted.
MRS:
PAGE. What? Thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy
gentry.
MRS:
FORD. We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive
how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men's
liking. And yet he would not swear; prais'd women's
modesty, and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof
to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no
more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth
Psalm to the tune of 'Greensleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly,
ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I
think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till
the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease.
Did you ever hear the like?
MRS:
PAGE. Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
Ford differs. To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill
opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy letter; but let thine
inherit first, for, I protest, mine never shall. I warrant he
hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
different names-sure, more!-and these are of the second
edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not
what he puts into the press when he would put us two. I
had rather be a giantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well,
I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste
man.
MRS:
FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the
very words. What doth he think of us?
MRS:
PAGE. Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain myself like
one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he
know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would
never have boarded me in this fury.
MRS:
FORD. 'Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
above deck.
MRS:
PAGE. So will I; if he come under my hatches, I'll never
to sea again. Let's be reveng'd on him; let's appoint him a
meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead
him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn'd his
horses to mine host of the Garter.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against
him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O
that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food
to his jealousy.
MRS:
PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man
too; he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him
cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.
MRS:
FORD. You are the happier woman.
MRS:
PAGE. Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
Come hither.
FORD:
Well, I hope it be not so.
PISTOL:
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs.
Sir John affects thy wife.
FORD:
Why, sir, my wife is not young.
PISTOL:
He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.
FORD:
Love my wife!
PISTOL:
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels.
O, odious is the name!
FORD:
What name, sir?
PISTOL:
The horn, I say. Farewell.
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night;
Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.
Away, Sir Corporal Nym.
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.
FORD:
[Aside]
NYM:
[To PAGE]
lying. He hath wronged me in some humours; I should
have borne the humour'd letter to her; but I have a sword,
and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife;
there's the short and the long.
My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch;
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
Adieu! I love not the humour of bread and cheese; and
there's the humour of it. Adieu.
PAGE:
'The humour of it,' quoth 'a! Here's a fellow frights
English out of his wits.
FORD:
I will seek out Falstaff.
PAGE:
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
FORD:
If I do find it-well.
PAGE:
I will not believe such a Cataian though the priest o'
th' town commended him for a true man.
FORD:
'Twas a good sensible fellow. Well.
PAGE:
How now, Meg!
MRS:
PAGE. Whither go you, George? Hark you.
MRS:
FORD. How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?
FORD:
I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home;
go.
MRS:
FORD. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.
Will you go, Mistress Page?
MRS:
PAGE. Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George?
be our messenger to this paltry knight.
MRS:
FORD. Trust me, I thought on
her; she'll fit it.
MRS:
PAGE. You are come to see my daughter Anne?
QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
MRS:
PAGE. Go in with us and see; we have an hour's talk
with you.
PAGE:
How now, Master Ford!
FORD:
You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
PAGE:
Yes; and you heard what the other told me?
FORD:
Do you think there is truth in them?
PAGE:
Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it;
but these that accuse him in his intent towards our
wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now
they be out of service.
FORD:
Were they his men?
PAGE:
Marry, were they.
FORD:
I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the
Garter?
PAGE:
Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what
he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.
FORD:
I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
turn them together. A man may be too confident. I would
have nothing lie on my head. I cannot be thus satisfied.
PAGE:
Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes.
There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse
when he looks so merrily. How now, mine host!
HOST:
How now, bully rook! Thou'rt a gentleman.
SHALLOW following]
SHALLOW:
I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with
us? We have sport in hand.
HOST:
Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bully rook.
SHALLOW:
Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
FORD:
Good mine host o' th' Garter, a word with you.
HOST:
What say'st thou, my bully rook?
SHALLOW:
[To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons; and,
I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe
me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you
what our sport shall be.
HOST:
Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaleiro.
FORD:
None, I protest; but I'll give you a pottle of burnt
sack to give me recourse to him, and tell him my name is
Brook-only for a jest.
HOST:
My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress-
said I well?-and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry
knight. Will you go, Mynheers?
SHALLOW:
Have with you, mine host.
PAGE:
I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his
rapier.
SHALLOW:
Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these
times you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
I know not what. 'Tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis here,
'tis here. I have seen the time with my long sword I would
have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
HOST:
Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?
PAGE:
Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than
fight.
FORD:
Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on
his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so
easily. She was in his company at Page's house, and what
they made there I know not. Well, I will look further into
't, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her
honest, I lose not my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour
well bestowed.
FALSTAFF:
I will not lend thee a penny.
PISTOL:
I will retort the sum in equipage.
FALSTAFF:
Not a penny.
PISTOL:
Why, then the world's mine oyster. Which I with
sword will open.
FALSTAFF:
Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated upon my good
friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow,
Nym; or else you had look'd through the grate, like a
geminy of baboons. I am damn'd in hell for swearing to
gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows;
and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan,
I took 't upon mine honour thou hadst it not.
PISTOL:
Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?
FALSTAFF:
Reason, you rogue, reason. Think'st thou I'll
endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me,
I am no gibbet for you. Go-a short knife and a throng!-
to your manor of Pickt-hatch; go. You'll not bear a letter
for me, you rogue! You stand upon your honour! Why,
thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to
keep the terms of my honour precise. I, I, I myself
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding
mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge,
and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags,
your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and
your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour!
You will not do it, you!
PISTOL:
I do relent; what would thou more of man?
ROBIN:
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
FALSTAFF:
Let her approach.
QUICKLY:
Give your worship good morrow.
FALSTAFF:
Good morrow, good wife.
QUICKLY:
Not so, an't please your worship.
FALSTAFF:
Good maid, then.
QUICKLY:
I'll be sworn;
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
FALSTAFF:
I do believe the swearer. What with me?
QUICKLY:
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
FALSTAFF:
Two thousand, fair woman; and I'll vouchsafe
thee the hearing.
QUICKLY:
There is one Mistress Ford, sir-I pray, come a little
nearer this ways. I myself dwell with Master Doctor
Caius.
FALSTAFF:
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say-
QUICKLY:
Your worship says very true. I pray your worship
come a little nearer this ways.
FALSTAFF:
I warrant thee nobody hears-mine own people,
mine own people.
QUICKLY:
Are they so? God bless them, and make them his
servants!
FALSTAFF:
Well; Mistress Ford, what of her?
QUICKLY:
Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord, Lord, your
worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of
us, I pray.
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford-
QUICKLY:
Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful.
The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor,
could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet
there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with
their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after
letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant
terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the
fairest, that would have won any woman's heart; and I
warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her.
I had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I
defy all angels, in any such sort, as they say, but in the
way of honesty; and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all;
and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more,
pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
FALSTAFF:
But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-
Mercury.
QUICKLY:
Marry, she hath receiv'd your letter; for the
which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
to notify that her husband will be absence from his house
between ten and eleven.
FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven?
QUICKLY:
Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see
the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her
husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads
an ill life with him! He's a very jealousy man; she leads a
very frampold life with him, good heart.
FALSTAFF:
Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I
will not fail her.
QUICKLY:
Why, you say well. But I have another messenger
to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations
to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she's as
fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will
not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in
Windsor, whoe'er be the other; and she bade me tell your
worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she
hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so
dote upon a man: surely I think you have charms, la! Yes,
in truth.
FALSTAFF:
Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my
good parts aside, I have no other charms.
QUICKLY:
Blessing on your heart for 't!
FALSTAFF:
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
QUICKLY:
That were a jest indeed! They have not so little
grace, I hope-that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page
would desire you to send her your little page of all loves.
Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page;
and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
Windsor leads a better life than she does; do what she will,
say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she
list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she
deserves it; for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she
is one. You must send her your page; no remedy.
FALSTAFF:
Why, I will.
QUICKLY:
Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come
and go between you both; and in any case have a
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy
never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that
children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you
know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
FALSTAFF:
Fare thee well; commend me to them both.
There's my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
this woman. This news
distracts me.
PISTOL:
[Aside]
Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights;
Give fire; she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
FALSTAFF:
Say'st thou so, old Jack; go thy ways; I'll make
more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look
after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money,
be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say
'tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.
BARDOLPH:
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would
fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.
FALSTAFF:
Brook is his name?
BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Call him in. Such Brooks are
welcome to me, that o'erflows such liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress
Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompass'd you? Go to;
via!
FORD:
Bless you, sir!
FALSTAFF:
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
FORD:
I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
you.
FALSTAFF:
You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave,
drawer.
FORD:
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name
is Brook.
FALSTAFF:
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance
of you.
FORD:
Good Sir John, I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I
must let you understand I think myself in better plight for
a lender than you are; the which hath something
embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they say, if
money go before, all ways do lie open.
FALSTAFF:
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
FORD:
Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me; if
you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing
me of the carriage.
FALSTAFF:
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your
porter.
FORD:
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
FALSTAFF:
Speak, good Master Brook; I shall be glad to be
your servant.
FORD:
Sir, I hear you are a scholar-I will be brief with you
had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted
with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein
I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but,
good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you
hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your
own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender.
FALSTAFF:
Very well, sir; proceed.
FORD:
There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's
name is Ford.
FALSTAFF:
Well, sir.
FORD:
I have long lov'd her, and, I protest to you, bestowed
much on her; followed her with a doting observance;
engross'd opportunities to meet her; fee'd every slight occasion
that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not
only bought many presents to give her, but have given
largely to many to know what she would have given;
briefly, I have pursu'd her as love hath pursued me; which
hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I
have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I
am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a jewel;
that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath
taught me to say this:
'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
FALSTAFF:
Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at
her hands?
FORD:
Never.
FALSTAFF:
Have you importun'd her to such a purpose?
FORD:
Never.
FALSTAFF. Of what quality was your love, then?
FORD:
Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where
erected it.
FALSTAFF:
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
FORD:
When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some
say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other
places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd
construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart
of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in
your place and person, generally allow'd for your many
war-like, courtlike, and learned preparations.
FALSTAFF:
O, sir!
FORD:
Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend it,
spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so
much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable
siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife; use your art of
wooing, win her to consent to you; if any man may, you
may as soon as any.
FALSTAFF. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
FORD:
O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the
excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares
not present itself; she is too bright to be look'd against.
Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand,
my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves;
I could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her
defences, which now are too too strongly embattl'd against
me. What say you to't, Sir John?
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman,
you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
FORD:
O good sir!
FALSTAFF:
I say you shall.
FORD:
Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
FALSTAFF:
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall
want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own
appointment; even as you came in to me her assistant, or
go-between, parted from me; I say I shall be with her between
ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally
knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to me at
night; you shall know how I speed.
FORD:
I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
Sir?
FALSTAFF:
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him
not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which
his wife seems to me well-favour'd. I will use her as the
key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my harvest-home.
FORD:
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
if you saw him.
FALSTAFF:
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel;
it shall hang like a meteor o'er the cuckold's horns. Master
Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the
peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at
night. Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou,
Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold.
Come to me soon at night.
FORD:
What a damn'd Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident
jealousy? My wife hath sent to him; the hour is fix'd;
the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See
the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus'd,
my coffers ransack'd, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall
not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the
adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me
this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer,
well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils' additions, the names
of fiends. But cuckold! Wittol! Cuckold! the devil himself
hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust
his wife; he will not be jealous; I will rather trust a Fleming
with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my
cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to
walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then
she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what
they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break
their hearts but they will effect. God be prais'd for my
jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect
my wife, be reveng'd on Falstaff, and laugh at Page.
I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute
too late. Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
CAIUS:
Jack Rugby!
RUGBY:
Sir?
CAIUS:
Vat is de clock, Jack?
RUGBY:
'Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promis'd to
meet.
CAIUS:
By gar, he has save his soul dat he is no come; he has
pray his Pible well dat he is no come; by gar, Jack Rugby,
he is dead already, if he be come.
RUGBY:
He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill
him if he came.
CAIUS:
By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him. Take
your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.
RUGBY:
Alas, sir, I cannot fence!
CAIUS:
Villainy, take your rapier.
RUGBY:
Forbear; here's company.
HOST:
Bless thee, bully doctor!
SHALLOW:
Save you, Master Doctor Caius!
PAGE:
Now, good Master Doctor!
SLENDER:
Give you good morrow, sir.
CAIUS:
Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
HOST:
To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee traverse;
to see thee here, to see thee there; to see thee pass thy
punto, thy stock, thy reverse, thy distance, thy montant.
Is he dead, my Ethiopian? Is he dead, my Francisco? Ha,
bully! What says my Aesculapius? my Galen? my heart
of elder? Ha! is he dead, bully stale? Is he dead?
CAIUS:
By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de world; he is
not show his face.
HOST:
Thou art a Castalion-King-Urinal. Hector of Greece,
my boy!
CAIUS:
I pray you, bear witness that me have stay six or
seven, two tree hours for him, and he is no come.
SHALLOW:
He is the wiser man, Master Doctor: he is a curer
of souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should fight,
you go against the hair of your professions. Is it not true,
Master Page?
PAGE:
Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter,
though now a man of peace.
SHALLOW:
Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old, and
of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to make
one. Though we are justices, and doctors, and churchmen,
Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us; we are
the sons of women, Master Page.
PAGE:
'Tis true, Master Shallow.
SHALLOW:
It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
you have show'd yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh
hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You
must go with me, Master Doctor.
HOST:
Pardon, Guest Justice. A word, Mounseur Mockwater.
CAIUS:
Mock-vater! Vat is dat?
HOST:
Mockwater, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.
CAIUS:
By gar, then I have as much mockvater as de Englishman.
Scurvy jack-dog priest! By gar, me vill cut his ears.
HOST:
He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.
CAIUS:
Clapper-de-claw! Vat is dat?
HOST:
That is, he will make thee amends.
CAIUS:
By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me; for,
by gar, me vill have it.
HOST:
And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.
CAIUS:
Me tank you for dat.
HOST:
And, moreover, bully-but first:
Master Guest, and Master Page, and eke Cavaleiro Slender,
go you through the town to Frogmore.
PAGE:
[Aside]
HOST:
[Aside]
I will bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?
SHALLOW:
[Aside]
CAIUS:
By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a jack-
an-ape to Anne Page.
HOST:
Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold water
on thy choler; go about the fields with me through Frogmore;
I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a a
farm-house, a-feasting; and thou shalt woo her. Cried
game! Said I well?
CAIUS:
By gar, me dank you vor dat; by gar, I love you; and
I shall procure-a you de good guest, de earl, de knight, de
lords, de gentlemen, my patients.
HOST:
For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne
Page. Said I well?
CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis good; vell said.
HOST:
Let us wag, then.
CAIUS:
Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.
EVANS:
I pray you now, good Master Slender's serving-man,
and friend Simple by your name, which way have you
look'd for Master Caius, that calls himself Doctor of
Physic?
SIMPLE:
Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward; every
way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town way.
EVANS:
I most fehemently desire you you will also look that
way.
SIMPLE:
I will, Sir.
EVANS:
Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and trempling
of mind! I shall be glad if he have deceived me. How
melancholies I am! I will knog his urinals about his knave's
costard when I have goot opportunities for the ork. Pless
my soul!
To shallow rivers, to whose falls
Melodious birds sings madrigals;
There will we make our peds of roses,
And a thousand fragrant posies.
To shallow-
Mercy on me! I have a great dispositions to cry.
Melodious birds sing madrigals-
Whenas I sat in Pabylon-
And a thousand vagram posies.
To shallow, etc.
SIMPLE:
Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.
EVANS:
He's welcome.
To shallow rivers, to whose falls-
Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?
SIMPLE:
No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master
Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over the
stile, this way.
EVANS:
Pray you give me my gown; or else keep it in your
arms.
SHALLOW:
How now, Master Parson! Good morrow, good
Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
SLENDER:
[Aside]
PAGE:
Save you, good Sir Hugh!
EVANS:
Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!
SHALLOW:
What, the sword and the word! Do you study
them both, Master Parson?
PAGE:
And youthful still, in your doublet and hose, this raw
rheumatic day!
EVANS:
There is reasons and causes for it.
PAGE:
We are come to you to do a good office, Master
Parson.
EVANS:
Fery well; what is it?
PAGE:
Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike having
received wrong by some person, is at most odds with
his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.
SHALLOW:
I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning, so wide of
his own respect.
EVANS:
What is he?
PAGE:
I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the
renowned French physician.
EVANS:
Got's will and his passion of my heart! I had as lief
you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
PAGE:
Why?
EVANS:
He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and
Galen, and he is a knave besides-a cowardly knave as you
would desires to be acquainted withal.
PAGE:
I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
SLENDER:
[Aside]
SHALLOW:
It appears so, by his weapons. Keep them asunder;
here comes Doctor Caius.
PAGE:
Nay, good Master Parson, keep in your weapon.
SHALLOW:
So do you, good Master Doctor.
HOST:
Disarm them, and let them question; let them keep
their limbs whole and hack our English.
CAIUS:
I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
Verefore will you not meet-a me?
EVANS:
[Aside to CAIUS]
good time.
CAIUS:
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.
EVANS:
[Aside to CAIUS]
laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you in
friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.
for missing your meetings and appointments.
CAIUS:
Diable! Jack Rugby-mine Host de Jarteer-have I
not stay for him to kill him? Have I not, at de place I did
appoint?
EVANS:
As I am a Christians soul, now, look you, this is the
place appointed. I'll be judgment by mine host of the
Garter.
HOST:
Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,
soul-curer and body-curer.
CAIUS:
Ay, dat is very good! excellent!
HOST:
Peace, I say. Hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my
doctor? No; he gives me the potions and the motions. Shall I
lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? No; he gives me
the proverbs and the noverbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial;
so. Give me thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
deceiv'd you both; I have directed you to wrong places;
your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt
sack be the issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn. Follow
me, lads of peace; follow, follow, follow.
SHALLOW:
Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.
SLENDER:
[Aside]
CAIUS:
Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a de sot of us,
ha, ha?
EVANS:
This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I
desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog our prains
together to be revenge on this same scall, scurvy, cogging
companion, the host of the Garter.
CAIUS:
By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.
EVANS:
Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you follow.
MRS:
PAGE. Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were
wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
ROBIN:
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than
follow him like a dwarf.
MRS:
PAGE. O, you are a flattering boy; now I see you'll be a
courtier.
FORD:
Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?
MRS:
PAGE. Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?
FORD:
Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want of
company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two
would marry.
MRS:
PAGE. Be sure of that-two other husbands.
FORD:
Where had you this pretty weathercock?
MRS:
PAGE. I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
name, sirrah?
ROBIN:
Sir John Falstaff.
FORD:
Sir John Falstaff!
MRS:
PAGE. He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such
a league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
home indeed?
FORD:
Indeed she is.
MRS:
PAGE. By your leave, sir. I am sick till I see her.
FORD:
Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why,
this boy will carry a letter twenty mile as easy as a cannon
will shoot pointblank twelve score. He pieces out his wife's
inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage; and
now she's going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
man may hear this show'r sing in the wind. And Falstaff's
boy with her! Good plots! They are laid; and our revolted
wives share damnation together. Well; I will take him,
then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty
from the so seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself
for a secure and wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings
all my neighbours shall cry aim.
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
search; there I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather prais'd
for this than mock'd; for it is as positive as the earth is firm
that Falstaff is there. I will go.
FORD:
Trust me, a good knot; I have good cheer at home,
and I pray you all go with me.
SHALLOW:
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
SLENDER:
And so must I, sir; we have appointed to dine with
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more
money than I'll speak of.
SHALLOW:
We have linger'd about a match between Anne
Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have
our answer.
SLENDER:
I hope I have your good will, father Page.
PAGE:
You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you. But
my wife, Master Doctor, is for you altogether.
CAIUS:
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me; my nursh-a
Quickly tell me so mush.
HOST:
What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers,
he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks
holiday, he smells April and May; he will carry 't, he will
carry 't; 'tis in his buttons; he will carry 't.
PAGE:
Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
of no having: he kept company with the wild Prince and
Poins; he is of too high a region, he knows too much. No,
he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of
my substance; if he take her, let him take her simply; the
wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes
not that way.
FORD:
I beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have sport; I will
show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go; so shall
you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.
SHALLOW:
Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer
wooing at Master Page's.
CAIUS:
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
HOST:
Farewell, my hearts; I will to my honest knight
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
FORD:
[Aside]
him. I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?
ALL:
Have with you to see this monster.
MRS:
FORD. What, John! what, Robert!
MRS:
PAGE. Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket-
MRS:
FORD. I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
MRS:
PAGE. Come, come, come.
MRS:
FORD. Here, set it down.
MRS:
PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
MRS:
FORD. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I suddenly
call you, come forth, and, without any pause or
staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done,
trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters
in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch
close by the Thames side.
MRS:
PAGE. You will do it?
MRS:
FORD. I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
direction. Be gone, and come when you are call'd.
MRS:
PAGE. Here comes little Robin.
MRS:
FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with
you?
ROBIN:
My Master Sir John is come in at your back-door,
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
MRS:
PAGE. You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
ROBIN:
Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
being here, and hath threat'ned to put me into everlasting
liberty, if I tell you of it; for he swears he'll turn me away.
MRS:
PAGE. Thou 'rt a good boy; this secrecy of thine shall
be a tailor to thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and
hose. I'll go hide me.
MRS:
FORD. Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
MRS:
PAGE. I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.
MRS:
FORD. Go to, then; we'll use this unwholesome
humidity, this gross wat'ry pumpion; we'll teach him to
know turtles from jays.
FALSTAFF:
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?
Why, now let me die, for I have liv'd long enough; this is
the period of my ambition. O this blessed hour!
MRS:
FORD. O sweet Sir John!
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish; I would thy
husband were dead; I'll speak it before the best lord, I
would make thee my lady.
MRS:
FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful
lady.
FALSTAFF:
Let the court of France show me such another. I
see how thine eye would emulate the diamond; thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admittance.
MRS:
FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become
nothing else, nor that well neither.
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, thou art a tyrant to say so; thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of
thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a
semi-circled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune
thy foe were, not Nature, thy friend. Come, thou canst not
hide it.
MRS:
FORD. Believe me, there's no such thing in me.
FALSTAFF:
What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee
there's something extra-ordinary in thee. Come, I cannot
cog, and say thou art this and that, like a many of these
lisping hawthorn-buds that come like women in men's
apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time; I
cannot; but I love thee, none but thee; and thou deserv'st it.
MRS:
FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress
Page.
FALSTAFF:
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a
lime-kiln.
MRS:
FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you
shall one day find it.
FALSTAFF:
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could
not be in that mind.
ROBIN:
[Within]
Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking
wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
FALSTAFF:
She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind
the arras.
MRS:
FORD. Pray you, do so; she's a very tattling woman.
What's the matter? How now!
MRS:
PAGE. O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're
sham'd, y'are overthrown, y'are undone for ever.
MRS:
FORD. What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
MRS:
PAGE. O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest
man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
MRS:
FORD. What cause of suspicion?
MRS:
PAGE. What cause of suspicion? Out upon you, how
am I mistook in you!
MRS:
FORD. Why, alas, what's the matter?
MRS:
PAGE. Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all
the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he
says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an
ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.
MRS:
FORD. 'Tis not so, I hope.
MRS:
PAGE. Pray heaven it be not so that you have such a
man here; but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I
come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, why,
I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey,
convey him out. Be not amaz'd; call all your senses to you;
defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life
for ever.
MRS:
FORD. What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear
friend; and I fear not mine own shame as much as his peril.
I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the
house.
MRS:
PAGE. For shame, never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
had rather'! Your husband's here at hand; bethink you of
some conveyance; in the house you cannot hide him. O,
how have you deceiv'd me! Look, here is a basket; if he be
of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw
foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking, or-it is
whiting-time-send him by your two men to Datchet
Mead.
MRS:
FORD. He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
FALSTAFF:
[Coming forward]
let me see 't! I'll in, I'll in; follow your friend's counsel;
I'll in.
MRS:
PAGE. What, Sir John Falstaff!
Are these your letters, knight?
FALSTAFF:
[Aside to MRS. PAGE]
thee; help me away.-Let me creep in here; I'll never-
MRS:
PAGE. Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!
MRS:
FORD. What, John! Robert! John!
Go, take up these clothes here, quickly; where's the
cowl-staff? Look how you drumble. Carry them to the laundress
in Datchet Mead; quickly, come.
FORD:
Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why
then make sport at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve
it. How now, whither bear you this?
SERVANT:
To the laundress, forsooth.
MRS:
FORD. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it?
You were best meddle with buck-washing.
FORD:
Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck!
Buck, buck, buck! ay, buck! I warrant you, buck; and of
the season too, it shall appear.

dream. Here, here, here be my keys; ascend my chambers,
search, seek, find out. I'll warrant we'll unkennel the fox.
Let me stop this way first. So, now
uncape.
PAGE:
Good Master Ford, be contented; you wrong yourself
too much.
FORD:
True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport
anon; follow me, gentlemen.
EVANS:
This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
CAIUS:
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous
in France.
PAGE:
Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his
search.
MRS:
PAGE. Is there not a double excellency in this?
MRS:
FORD. I know not which pleases me better, that my
husband is deceived, or Sir John.
MRS:
PAGE. What a taking was he in when your husband
ask'd who was in the basket!
MRS:
FORD. I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
MRS:
PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the
same strain were in the same distress.
MRS:
FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion
of Falstaff's being here, for I never saw him so gross in his
jealousy till now.
MRS:
PAGE. I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have
more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce
obey this medicine.
MRS:
FORD. Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water,
and give him another hope, to betray him to another
punishment?
MRS:
PAGE. We will do it; let him be sent for to-morrow
eight o'clock, to have amends.
FORD:
I cannot find him; may be the knave bragg'd of that
he could not compass.
MRS:
PAGE. Heard you that?
MRS:
FORD. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
FORD:
Ay, I do so.
MRS:
FORD. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
FORD:
Amen.
MRS:
PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
FORD:
Ay, ay; I must bear it.
EVANS:
If there be any pody in the house, and in the
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive
my sins at the day of judgment!
CAIUS:
Be gar, nor I too; there is no bodies.
PAGE:
Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not asham'd? What
spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha'
your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor
Castle.
FORD:
'Tis my fault, Master Page; I suffer for it.
EVANS:
You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as
honest a omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five
hundred too.
CAIUS:
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
FORD:
Well, I promis'd you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
the Park. I pray you pardon me; I will hereafter make
known to you why I have done this. Come, wife, come,
Mistress Page; I pray you pardon me; pray heartly,
pardon me.
PAGE:
Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock him.
I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to breakfast;
after, we'll a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for
the bush. Shall it be so?
FORD:
Any thing.
EVANS:
If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
CAIUS:
If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
FORD:
Pray you go, Master Page.
EVANS:
I pray you now, remembrance to-morrow on the
lousy knave, mine host.
CAIUS:
Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart.
EVANS:
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!
FENTON:
I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
ANNE:
Alas, how then?
FENTON:
Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth;
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.
ANNE:
. May be he tells you true.
FENTON:
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne;
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.
ANNE:
Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then-hark you hither.
SHALLOW:
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly; my kinsman
shall speak for himself.
SLENDER:
I'll make a shaft or a bolt on 't; 'slid, 'tis but
venturing.
SHALLOW:
Be not dismay'd.
SLENDER:
No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that,
but that I am afeard.
QUICKLY:
Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word
with you.
ANNE:
I come to him. This is my father's choice.
O, what a world of vile ill-favour'd faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!
QUICKLY:
And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a
word with you.
SHALLOW:
She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a
father!
SLENDER:
I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell
you good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne
the jest how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good
uncle.
SHALLOW:
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
SLENDER:
Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
Gloucestershire.
SHALLOW:
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
SLENDER:
Ay, that I will come cut and longtail, under the
degree of a squire.
SHALLOW:
He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds
jointure.
ANNE:
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
SHALLOW:
Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that
good comfort. She calls you, coz; I'll leave you.
ANNE:
Now, Master Slender-
SLENDER:
Now, good Mistress Anne-
ANNE:
What is your will?
SLENDER:
My Will! 'Od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not
such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
ANNE:
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
SLENDER:
Truly, for mine own part I would little or nothing
with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions;
if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They
can tell you how things go better than I can. You may ask
your father; here he comes.
PAGE:
Now, Master Slender! Love him, daughter Anne-
Why, how now, what does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.
I told you, sir, my daughter is dispos'd of.
FENTON:
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
MRS:
PAGE. Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
PAGE:
She is no match for you.
FENTON:
Sir, will you hear me?
PAGE:
No, good Master Fenton.
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender; in.
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
QUICKLY:
Speak to Mistress Page.
FENTON:
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love,
And not retire. Let me have your good will.
ANNE:
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
MRS:
PAGE. I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
QUICKLY:
That's my master, Master Doctor.
ANNE:
Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth.
And bowl'd to death with turnips.
MRS:
PAGE. Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master
Fenton,
I will not be your friend, nor enemy;
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected;
Till then, farewell, sir; she must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.
FENTON:
Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.
QUICKLY:
This is my doing now: 'Nay,' said I 'will you cast
away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
Master Fenton.' This is my doing.
FENTON:
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring. There's for thy pains.
QUICKLY:
Now Heaven send thee good fortune!
FENTON]
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my
master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had
her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her; I will
do what I can for them all three, for so I have promis'd,
and I'll be as good as my word; but speciously for Master
Fenton. Well, I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff
from my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!
FALSTAFF:
Bardolph, I say!
BARDOLPH:
Here, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in 't.
Have I liv'd to be carried in a basket, like a barrow of
butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the Thames? Well, if
I be serv'd such another trick, I'll have my brains ta'en out
and butter'd, and give them to a dog for a new-year's gift.
The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse
as they would have drown'd a blind bitch's puppies, fifteen
i' th' litter; and you may know by my size that I have
a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as deep as
hell I should down. I had been drown'd but that the shore
was shelvy and shallow-a death that I abhor; for the water
swells a man; and what a thing should I have been when
had been swell'd! I should have been a mountain of
mummy.
BARDOLPH:
Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you
FALSTAFF:
Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames
water; for my belly's as cold as if I had swallow'd
snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call her in.
BARDOLPH:
Come in, woman.
QUICKLY:
By your leave; I cry you mercy. Give your
worship good morrow.
FALSTAFF:
Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle
of sack finely.
BARDOLPH:
With eggs, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my
brewage. How now!
QUICKLY:
Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress
Ford.
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was
thrown into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.
QUICKLY:
Alas the day, good heart, that was not her fault!
She does so take on with her men; they mistook their
erection.
FALSTAFF:
So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's
promise.
QUICKLY:
Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her between
eight and nine; I must carry her word quickly. She'll make
you amends, I warrant you.
FALSTAFF:
Well, I Will visit her. Tell her so; and bid her
think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty, and then
judge of my merit.
QUICKLY:
I will tell her.
FALSTAFF:
Do so. Between nine and ten, say'st thou?
QUICKLY:
Eight and nine, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Well, be gone; I will not miss her.
QUICKLY:
Peace be with you, sir.
FALSTAFF:
I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me
word to stay within. I like his money well. O, here he
comes.
FORD:
Bless you, sir!
FALSTAFF:
Now, Master Brook, you come to know what
hath pass'd between me and Ford's wife?
FORD:
That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will not lie to you; I was at her
house the hour she appointed me.
FORD:
And sped you, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.
FORD:
How so, sir; did she change her determination?
FALSTAFF:
No. Master Brook; but the peaking cornuto her
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual 'larum of
jealousy, comes me in the instant of our, encounter, after
we had embrac'd, kiss'd, protested, and, as it were, spoke
the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his
companions, thither provoked and instigated by his
distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife's
love.
FORD:
What, while you were there?
FALSTAFF:
While I was there.
FORD:
And did he search for you, and could not find you?
FALSTAFF:
You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford's approach;
and, in her invention and Ford's wife's distraction, they
convey'd me into a buck-basket.
FORD:
A buck-basket!
FALSTAFF:
By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm'd me in with
foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound
of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
FORD:
And how long lay you there?
FALSTAFF:
Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
suffer'd to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being
thus cramm'd in the basket, a couple of Ford's knaves, his
hinds, were call'd forth by their mistress to carry me in
the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane; they took me on
their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the
door; who ask'd them once or twice what they had in their
basket. I quak'd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have
search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold,
held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away
went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master
Brook-I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,
an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the
circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and
then, to be stopp'd in, like a strong distillation, with
stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that
heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It
was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of
this bath, when I was more than half-stew'd in grease, like
a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool'd,
glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that
FORD:
In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you
have suffer'd all this. My suit, then, is desperate;
you'll undertake her no more.
FALSTAFF:
Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I
have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from
her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is
the hour, Master Brook.
FORD:
'Tis past eight already, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Is it? I Will then address me to my appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned
with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her, Master
Brook; Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.
FORD:
Hum! ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep?
Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford. There's a hole
made in your best coat, Master Ford. This 'tis to be
married; this 'tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will
proclaim myself what I am; I will now take the lecher; he
is at my house. He cannot scape me; 'tis impossible he
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into
a pepper box. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid
him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I
cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make
me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb
go with me-I'll be horn mad.
MRS:
PAGE. Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
QUICKLY:
Sure he is by this; or will be presently; but truly
he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the
water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.
MRS:
PAGE. I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my
young man here to school. Look where his master comes;
'tis a playing day, I see.
How now, Sir Hugh, no school to-day?
EVANS:
No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
QUICKLY:
Blessing of his heart!
MRS:
PAGE. Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits
nothing in the world at his book; I pray you ask him some
questions in his accidence.
EVANS:
Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
MRS:
PAGE. Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
master; be not afraid.
EVANS:
William, how many numbers is in nouns?
WILLIAM:
Two.
QUICKLY:
Truly, I thought there had been one number
more, because they say 'Od's nouns.'
EVANS:
Peace your tattlings. What is 'fair,' William?
WILLIAM:
Pulcher.
QUICKLY:
Polecats! There are fairer things than polecats,
sure.
EVANS:
You are a very simplicity oman; I pray you, peace.
What is 'lapis,' William?
WILLIAM:
A stone.
EVANS:
And what is 'a stone,' William?
WILLIAM:
A pebble.
EVANS:
No, it is 'lapis'; I pray you remember in your prain.
WILLIAM:
Lapis.
EVANS:
That is a good William. What is he, William, that
does lend articles?
WILLIAM:
Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be
thus declined: Singulariter, nominativo; hic, haec, hoc.
EVANS:
Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark: genitivo,
hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?
WILLIAM:
Accusativo, hinc.
EVANS:
I pray you, have your remembrance, child.
Accusativo, hung, hang, hog.
QUICKLY:
'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
EVANS:
Leave your prabbles, oman. What is the focative
case, William?
WILLIAM:
O-vocativo, O.
EVANS:
Remember, William: focative is caret.
QUICKLY:
And that's a good root.
EVANS:
Oman, forbear.
MRS:
PAGE. Peace.
EVANS:
What is your genitive case plural, William?
WILLIAM:
Genitive case?
EVANS:
Ay.
WILLIAM:
Genitive: horum, harum, horum.
QUICKLY:
Vengeance of Jenny's case; fie on her! Never
name her, child, if she be a whore.
EVANS:
For shame, oman.
QUICKLY:
YOU do ill to teach the child such words. He
teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do fast
enough of themselves; and to call 'horum'; fie upon you!
EVANS:
Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings
for thy cases, and the numbers of the genders? Thou
art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.
MRS:
PAGE. Prithee hold thy peace.
EVANS:
Show me now, William, some declensions of your
pronouns.
WILLIAM:
Forsooth, I have forgot.
EVANS:
It is qui, quae, quod; if you forget your qui's, your
quae's, and your quod's, you must be preeches. Go your
ways and play; go.
MRS:
PAGE. He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
EVANS:
He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.
MRS:
PAGE. Adieu, good Sir Hugh.
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.
FALSTAFF:
Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love, and I
profess requital to a hair's breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in
the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your
husband now?
MRS:
FORD. He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
MRS:
PAGE. What hoa, gossip Ford, what hoa!
MRS:
FORD. Step into th' chamber, Sir John.
MRS:
PAGE. How now, sweetheart, who's at home besides
yourself?
MRS:
FORD. Why, none but mine own people.
MRS:
PAGE. Indeed?
MRS:
FORD. No, certainly. Speak louder.
MRS:
PAGE. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
MRS:
FORD. Why?
MRS:
PAGE. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes
again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
against all married mankind; so curses an Eve's daughters,
of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the
forehead, crying 'Peer-out, peer-out!' that any madness I
ever yet beheld seem'd but tameness, civility, and patience,
to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight
is not here.
MRS:
FORD. Why, does he talk of him?
MRS:
PAGE. Of none but him; and swears he was carried out,
the last time he search'd for him, in a basket; protests to
my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the
rest of their company from their sport, to make another
experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not
here; now he shall see his own foolery.
MRS:
FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?
MRS:
PAGE. Hard by, at street end; he will be here anon.
MRS:
FORD. I am undone: the knight is here.
MRS:
PAGE. Why, then, you are utterly sham'd, and he's but
a dead man. What a woman are you! Away with him,
away with him; better shame than murder.
MRS:
FORD. Which way should he go? How should I bestow
him? Shall I put him into the basket again?
FALSTAFF:
No, I'll come no more i' th' basket. May I not go
out ere he come?
MRS:
PAGE. Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the
door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you
might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?
FALSTAFF:
What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.
MRS:
FORD. There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces.
MRS:
PAGE. Creep into the kiln-hole.
FALSTAFF:
Where is it?
MRS:
FORD. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for
the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his
note. There is no hiding you in the house.
FALSTAFF:
I'll go out then.
MRS:
PAGE. If you go out in your own semblance, you die,
Sir John. Unless you go out disguis'd.
MRS:
FORD. How might we disguise him?
MRS:
PAGE. Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's
gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a
hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape.
FALSTAFF:
Good hearts, devise something; any extremity
rather than a mischief.
MRS:
FORD. My Maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has
a gown above.
MRS:
PAGE. On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
is; and there's her thrumm'd hat, and her muffler too. Run
up, Sir John.
MRS:
FORD. Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will
look some linen for your head.
MRS:
PAGE. Quick, quick; we'll come dress you straight. Put
on the gown the while.
MRS:
FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this
shape; he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford; he
swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath
threat'ned to beat her.
MRS:
PAGE. Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and
the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
MRS:
FORD. But is my husband coming?
MRS:
PAGE. Ay, in good sadness is he; and talks of the basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.
MRS:
FORD. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry
the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they
did last time.
MRS:
PAGE. Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress
him like the witch of Brainford.
MRS:
FORD. I'll first direct my men what they shall do with
the basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.
MRS:
PAGE. Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse
him enough.
We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
Wives may be merry and yet honest too.
We do not act that often jest and laugh;
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.
MRS:
FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders;
your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey
him; quickly, dispatch.
FIRST SERVANT:
Come, come, take it up.
SECOND SERVANT:
Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
FIRST SERVANT:
I hope not; I had lief as bear so much lead.
Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS
FORD:
Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain!
Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly
rascals, there's a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy
against me. Now shall the devil be sham'd. What, wife, I
say! Come, come forth; behold what honest clothes you
send forth to bleaching.
PAGE:
Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose
any longer; you must be pinion'd.
EVANS:
Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad dog.
SHALLOW:
Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
FORD:
So say I too, sir.
Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest
woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath
the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect without cause,
Mistress, do I?
MRS:
FORD. Heaven be my witness, you do, if you suspect
me in any dishonesty.
FORD:
Well said, brazen-face; hold it out. Come forth, sirrah.
PAGE:
This passes!
MRS:
FORD. Are you not asham'd? Let the clothes alone.
FORD:
I shall find you anon.
EVANS:
'Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife's
clothes? Come away.
FORD:
Empty the basket, I say.
MRS:
FORD. Why, man, why?
FORD:
Master Page, as I am a man, there was one convey'd
out of my house yesterday in this basket. Why may not
he be there again? In my house I am sure he is; my
intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.
MRS:
FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's
death.
PAGE:
Here's no man.
SHALLOW:
By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
wrongs you.
EVANS:
Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
imaginations of your own heart; this is jealousies.
FORD:
Well, he's not here I seek for.
PAGE:
No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
FORD:
Help to search my house this one time. If I find not
what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for
ever be your table sport; let them say of me 'As jealous as
Ford, that search'd a hollow walnut for his wife's leman.'
Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.
MRS:
FORD. What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old
woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.
FORD:
Old woman? what old woman's that?
MRS:
FORD. Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford.
FORD:
A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We
are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass
under the profession of fortune-telling. She works by
charms, by spells, by th' figure, and such daub'ry as this
is, beyond our element. We know nothing. Come down, you
witch, you hag you; come down, I say.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, good sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let
him not strike the old woman.
MRS:
PAGE. Come, Mother Prat; come. give me your hand.
FORD:
I'll prat her. Out of my door, you
witch, you hag, you. baggage, you polecat, you ronyon!
Out, out! I'll conjure you, I'll fortune-tell you.
MRS:
PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kill'd the
poor woman.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
FORD:
Hang her, witch!
EVANS:
By yea and no, I think the oman is a witch indeed; I
like not when a oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard
under his muffler.
FORD:
Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow;
see but the issue of my jealousy; if I cry out thus upon no
trail, never trust me when I open again.
PAGE:
Let's obey his humour a little further. Come,
gentlemen.
MRS:
PAGE. Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
MRS:
FORD. Nay, by th' mass, that he did not; he beat him
most unpitifully methought.
MRS:
PAGE. I'll have the cudgel hallow'd and hung o'er the
altar; it hath done meritorious service.
MRS:
FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue
him with any further revenge?
MRS:
PAGE. The spirit of wantonness is sure scar'd out of
him; if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with fine and
recovery, he will never, I think, in the way of waste,
attempt us again.
MRS:
FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd
him?
MRS:
PAGE. Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
figures out of your husband's brains. If they can find in their
hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further
afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.
MRS:
FORD. I'll warrant they'll have him publicly sham'd;
and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should
he not be publicly sham'd.
MRS:
PAGE. Come, to the forge with it then; shape it. I
would not have things cool.
BARDOLPH:
Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses; the Duke himself will be to-morrow at court, and
they are going to meet him.
HOST:
What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the gentlemen;
they speak English?
BARDOLPH:
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
HOST:
They shall have my horses, but I'll make them pay;
I'll sauce them; they have had my house a week at
command; I have turn'd away my other guests. They must
come off; I'll sauce them. Come.
EVANS:
'Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever
did look upon.
PAGE:
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
MRS:
PAGE. Within a quarter of an hour.
FORD:
Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt;
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honour stand,
In him that was of late an heretic,
As firm as faith.
PAGE:
'Tis well, 'tis well; no more.
Be not as extreme in submission as in offence;
But let our plot go forward. Let our wives
Yet once again, to make us public sport,
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
FORD:
There is no better way than that they spoke of.
PAGE:
How? To send him word they'll meet him in the Park
at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come!
EVANS:
You say he has been thrown in the rivers; and has
been grievously peaten as an old oman; methinks there
should be terrors in him, that he should not come;
methinks his flesh is punish'd; he shall have no desires.
PAGE:
So think I too.
MRS:
FORD. Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
And let us two devise to bring him thither.
MRS:
PAGE. There is an old tale goes that Heme the Hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner.
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Receiv'd, and did deliver to our age,
This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truth.
PAGE:
Why yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak.
But what of this?
MRS:
FORD. Marry, this is our device-
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,
Disguis'd, like Heme, with huge horns on his head.
PAGE:
Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come,
And in this shape. When you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? What is your plot?
MRS:
PAGE. That likewise have we thought upon, and
thus:
Nan Page my daughter, and my little son,
And three or four more of their growth, we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands; upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song; upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly.
Then let them all encircle him about,
And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight;
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.
MRS:
FORD. And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,
And burn him with their tapers.
MRS:
PAGE. The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.
FORD:
The children must
Be practis'd well to this or they'll nev'r do 't.
EVANS:
I will teach the children their behaviours; and I will
be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my
taber.
FORD:
That will be excellent. I'll go buy them vizards.
MRS:
PAGE. My Nan shall be the Queen of all the Fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.
PAGE:
That silk will I go buy. And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,
And marry her at Eton.-Go, send to Falstaff straight.
FORD:
Nay, I'll to him again, in name of Brook;
He'll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he'll come.
MRS:
PAGE. Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.
EVANS:
Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures, and fery
honest knaveries.
MRS:
PAGE. Go, Mistress Ford.
Send Quickly to Sir John to know his mind.
I'll to the Doctor; he hath my good will,
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The Doctor is well money'd, and his friends
Potent at court; he, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
HOST:
What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thick-skin?
Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.
SIMPLE:
Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
from Master Slender.
HOST:
There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about with the
story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and can; he'll
speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee. Knock, I say.
SIMPLE:
There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into
his chamber; I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down;
I come to speak with her, indeed.
HOST:
Ha! a fat woman? The knight may be robb'd. I'll call.
Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs
military. Art thou there? It is thine host, thine Ephesian, calls.
FALSTAFF:
[Above]
HOST:
Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her descend;
my chambers are honourible. Fie, privacy, fie!
FALSTAFF:
There was, mine host, an old fat woman even
now with, me; but she's gone.
SIMPLE:
Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
Brainford?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you
with her?
SIMPLE:
My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her,
seeing her go thorough the streets, to know, sir, whether one
Nym, sir, that beguil'd him of a chain, had the chain or no.
FALSTAFF:
I spake with the old woman about it.
SIMPLE:
And what says she, I pray, sir?
beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it.
SIMPLE:
I would I could have spoken with the woman
herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too,
from him.
FALSTAFF:
What are they? Let us know.
HOST:
Ay, come; quick.
SIMPLE:
I may not conceal them, sir.
FALSTAFF:
Conceal them, or thou diest.
SIMPLE.. Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress
Anne Page: to know if it were my master's fortune to
have her or no.
FALSTAFF:
'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
SIMPLE:
What sir?
FALSTAFF:
To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me
so.
SIMPLE:
May I be bold to say so, sir?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, sir, like who more bold?
SIMPLE:
, I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad
with these tidings.
HOST:
Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
there a wise woman with thee?
FALSTAFF:
Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath
taught me more wit than ever I learn'd before in my life;
and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my
learning.
BARDOLPH:
Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!
HOST:
Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto.
BARDOLPH:
Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I
came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like
three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
HOST:
They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain; do not
say they be fled. Germans are honest men.
EVANS:
Where is mine host?
HOST:
What is the matter, sir?
EVANS:
Have a care of your entertainments. There is a friend
of mine come to town tells me there is three
cozen-germans that has cozen'd all the hosts of Readins,
of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money. I tell you for
good will, look you; you are wise, and full of gibes and
vlouting-stogs, and 'tis not convenient you should be
cozened. Fare you well.
CAIUS:
Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
HOST:
Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful
dilemma.
CAIUS:
I cannot tell vat is dat; but it is tell-a me dat you
make grand preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my
trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come; I
tell you for good will. Adieu.
HOST:
Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight; I am
undone. Fly, run, hue and cry, villain; I am undone.
FALSTAFF:
I would all the world might be cozen'd, for I have
been cozen'd and beaten too. If it should come to the car
of the court how I have been transformed, and how my
transformation hath been wash'd and cudgell'd, they
would melt me out of my fat, drop by drop, and liquor
fishermen's boots with me; I warrant they would whip me
with their fine wits till I were as crestfall'n as a dried pear.
I never prosper'd since I forswore myself at primero. Well,
if my wind were but long enough to say my prayers,
would repent.
Now! whence come you?
QUICKLY:
From the two parties, forsooth.
FALSTAFF:
The devil take one party and his dam the other!
And so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffer'd more
for their sakes, more than the villainous inconstancy of
man's disposition is able to bear.
QUICKLY:
And have not they suffer'd? Yes, I warrant;
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten
black and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.
FALSTAFF:
What tell'st thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow; and
was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford. But
that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the
action of an old woman, deliver'd me, the knave constable
had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' common stocks, for a witch.
QUICKLY:
Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber; you
shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content.
Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good hearts, what ado
here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not
serve heaven well, that you are so cross'd.
FALSTAFF:
Come up into my chamber.
HOST:
Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I
will give over all.
FENTON:
Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give the
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
HOST:
I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will, at the least,
keep your counsel.
FENTON:
From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who, mutually, hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish. I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter
That neither, singly, can be manifested
Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene. The image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:
To-night at Heme's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen-
The purpose why is here-in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender, and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry; she hath consented.
Now, sir,
Her mother, even strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the dean'ry, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her. To this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white;
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him; her mother hath intended
The better to denote her to the doctor-
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded-
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob'd,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.
HOST:
Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
FENTON:
Both, my good host, to go along with me.
And here it rests-that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church, 'twixt twelve and one,
And in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.
HOST:
Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar.
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.
FENTON:
So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
FALSTAFF:
Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll, hold. This is
the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.
Away, go; they say there is divinity in odd numbers, either
in nativity, chance, or death. Away.
QUICKLY:
I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do what I can to
get you a pair of horns.
FALSTAFF:
Away, I say; time wears; hold up your head, and
mince.
How now, Master Brook. Master Brook, the matter will
be known tonight or never. Be you in the Park about
midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall see wonders.
FORD:
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
you had appointed?
FALSTAFF:
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a
poor old man; but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath
the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that
ever govern'd frenzy. I will tell you-he beat me grievously
in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master
Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because
I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along with
me; I'll. tell you all, Master Brook. Since I pluck'd geese,
play'd truant, and whipp'd top, I knew not what 'twas to
be beaten till lately. Follow me. I'll tell you strange things
of this knave-Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged,
and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange
things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
PAGE:
Come, come; we'll couch i' th' Castle ditch till we
see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter.
SLENDER:
Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her, and we have
a nay-word how to know one another. I come to her in
white and cry 'mum'; she cries 'budget,' and by that we
know one another.
SHALLOW:
That's good too; but what needs either your mum
or her budget? The white will decipher her well enough.
It hath struck ten o'clock.
PAGE:
The night is dark; light and spirits will become it well.
Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the
devil, and we shall know him by his horns. Let's away;
follow me.
MRS:
PAGE. Master Doctor, my daughter is in green; when
you see your time, take her by the hand, away with her to
the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before into the
Park; we two must go together.
CAIUS:
I know vat I have to do; adieu.
MRS:
PAGE. Fare you well, sir. My husband
will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will
chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter; but 'tis no
matter; better a little chiding than a great deal of
heartbreak.
MRS:
FORD. Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and
the Welsh devil, Hugh?
MRS:
PAGE. They are all couch'd in a pit hard by Heme's
oak, with obscur'd lights; which, at the very instant of
Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once display to the
night.
MRS:
FORD. That cannot choose but amaze him.
MRS:
PAGE. If he be not amaz'd, he will be mock'd; if he be
amaz'd, he will every way be mock'd.
MRS:
FORD. We'll betray him finely.
MRS:
PAGE. Against such lewdsters and their lechery,
Those that betray them do no treachery.
MRS:
FORD. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
EVANS:
Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts.
Be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and when I
give the watch-ords, do as I pid you. Come, come; trib,
trib.
FALSTAFF:
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
draws on. Now the hot-blooded gods assist me!
Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love set on thy
horns. O powerful love! that in some respects makes a
beast a man; in some other a man a beast. You were also,
Jupiter, a swan, for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love!
how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A
fault done first in the form of a beast-O Jove, a beastly
fault!-and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl-
think on't, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs
what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor
stag; and the fattest, I think, i' th' forest. Send me a cool
rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow?
Who comes here? my doe?
MRS:
FORD. Sir John! Art thou there, my deer, my male deer.
FALSTAFF:
My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves, hail
kissing-comfits, and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest
of provocation, I will shelter me here.
MRS:
FORD. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
FALSTAFF:
Divide me like a brib'd buck, each a haunch; I
will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands. Am
I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Heme the Hunter? Why,
now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution.
As I am a true spirit, welcome!
MRS:
PAGE. Alas, what noise?
MRS:
FORD. Heaven forgive our sins!
FALSTAFF:
What should this be?
MRS:
FORD. } Away, away.
MRS:
PAGE. } Away, away.
FALSTAFF:
I think the devil will not have me damn'd, lest the
oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would never else
cross me thus.
FAIRY QUEEN:
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
You moonshine revellers, and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
PUCK:
Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap;
Where fires thou find'st unrak'd, and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry;
Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery.
FALSTAFF:
They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die.
I'll wink and couch; no man their works must eye.
EVANS:
Where's Pede? Go you, and where you find a maid
That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy;
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.
FAIRY QUEEN:
About, about;
Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out;
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room,
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower;
Each fair instalment, coat, and sev'ral crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring;
Th' expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In em'rald tufts, flow'rs purple, blue and white;
Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee.
Fairies use flow'rs for their charactery.
Away, disperse; but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.
EVANS:
Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set;
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay. I smell a man of middle earth.
FALSTAFF:
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese!
PUCK:
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
FAIRY QUEEN:
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end;
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend,
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
PUCK:
A trial, come.
EVANS:
Come, will this wood take fire?
FALSTAFF:
Oh, oh, oh!
FAIRY QUEEN:
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
THE SONG:
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire,
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire,
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villainy;
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about,
Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.
PAGE:
Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now.
Will none but Heme the Hunter serve your turn?
MRS:
PAGE. I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?
FORD:
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns,
Master Brook; and, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of
Ford's but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty pounds
of money, which must be paid to Master Brook; his horses
are arrested for it, Master Brook.
MRS:
FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never
meet. I will never take you for my love again; but I will
always count you my deer.
FALSTAFF:
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
FORD:
Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.
FALSTAFF:
And these are not fairies? I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the
guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers,
drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief,
in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they
were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent
when 'tis upon ill employment.
EVANS:
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires,
and fairies will not pinse you.
FORD:
Well said, fairy Hugh.
EVANS:
And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.
FORD:
I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able
to woo her in good English.
FALSTAFF:
Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that
it wants matter to prevent so gross, o'er-reaching as this?
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb
of frieze? 'Tis time I were chok'd with a piece of
toasted cheese.
EVANS:
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all
putter.
FALSTAFF:
'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I liv'd to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough
to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.
MRS:
PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would
have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and
shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
FORD:
What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
MRS:
PAGE. A puff'd man?
PAGE:
Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails?
FORD:
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
PAGE:
And as poor as Job?
FORD:
And as wicked as his wife?
EVANS:
And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack,
and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings, and swearings,
and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
FALSTAFF:
Well, I am your theme; you have the start of me;
I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel;
ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me; use me as you will.
FORD:
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one Master
Brook, that you have cozen'd of money, to whom you
should have been a pander. Over and above that you have
suffer'd, I think to repay that money will be a biting
affliction.
PAGE:
Yet be cheerful, knight; thou shalt eat a posset
tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my
wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath
married her daughter.
MRS:
PAGE. Doctors doubt that; if Anne Page be
my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
SLENDER:
Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!
PAGE:
Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'?
SLENDER:
Dispatch'd! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
know on't; would I were hang'd, la, else!
PAGE:
Of what, son?
SLENDER:
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne
Page, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i'
th' church, I would have swing'd him, or he should have
swing'd me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page,
would I might never stir!-and 'tis a postmaster's boy.
PAGE:
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
SLENDER:
What need you tell me that? I think so, when I
took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all
he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.
PAGE:
Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
you should know my daughter by her garments?
SLENDER:
I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she
cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was
not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
MRS:
PAGE. Good George, be not angry. I knew of your
purpose; turn'd my daughter into green; and, indeed, she
is now with the Doctor at the dean'ry, and there married.
CAIUS:
Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha'
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is
not Anne Page; by gar, I am cozened.
MRS:
PAGE. Why, did you take her in green?
CAIUS:
Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy; be gar, I'll raise all
Windsor.
FORD:
This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
PAGE:
My heart misgives me; here comes Master Fenton.
How now, Master Fenton!
ANNE:
Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
PAGE:
Now, Mistress, how chance you went not with Master
Slender?
MRS:
PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
FENTON:
You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
Th' offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
FORD:
Stand not amaz'd; here is no remedy.
In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state;
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
FALSTAFF:
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand
to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanc'd.
PAGE:
Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.
FALSTAFF:
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chas'd.
MRS:
PAGE. Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
Sir John and all.
FORD:
Let it be so. Sir John,
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word;
For he, to-night, shall lie with Mistress Ford.
THESEUS:
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager,
Long withering out a young man's revenue.
HIPPOLYTA:
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
THESEUS:
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
THESEUS:
Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?
EGEUS:
Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love,
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats- messengers
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth;
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
Be it so she will not here before your Grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
As she is mine I may dispose of her;
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
THESEUS:
What say you, Hermia? Be advis'd, fair maid.
To you your father should be as a god;
One that compos'd your beauties; yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax,
By him imprinted, and within his power
To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
HERMIA:
So is Lysander.
THESEUS:
In himself he is;
But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
HERMIA:
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
THESEUS:
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
HERMIA:
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
THESEUS:
Either to die the death, or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.
HERMIA:
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
THESEUS:
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon-
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship-
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
DEMETRIUS:
Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.
LYSANDER:
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's; do you marry him.
EGEUS:
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine; and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
LYSANDER:
I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
THESEUS:
I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will,
Or else the law of Athens yields you up-
Which by no means we may extenuate-
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?
Demetrius, and Egeus, go along;
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial, and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
EGEUS:
With duty and desire we follow you.
LYSANDER:
How now, my love! Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
HERMIA:
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
LYSANDER:
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But either it was different in blood-
HERMIA:
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
LYSANDER:
Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
HERMIA:
O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
LYSANDER:
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
HERMIA:
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
LYSANDER:
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,
Making it momentary as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up;
So quick bright things come to confusion.
HERMIA:
If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny.
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor Fancy's followers.
LYSANDER:
A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child-
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues-
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.
HERMIA:
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow, with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
LYSANDER:
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
HERMIA:
God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
HELENA:
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching; O, were favour so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go!
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
HERMIA:
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
HELENA:
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
HERMIA:
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
HELENA:
O that my prayers could such affection move!
HERMIA:
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
HELENA:
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
HERMIA:
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
HELENA:
None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
HERMIA:
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me.
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
LYSANDER:
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
HERMIA:
And in the wood where often you and I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow; pray thou for us,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
LYSANDER:
I will, my Hermia. Helena, adieu;
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you.
HELENA:
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know.
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste;
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere;
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolv'd, and show'rs of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
QUINCE:
Is all our company here?
BOTTOM:
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according
to the scrip.
QUINCE:
Here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought
fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke
and the Duchess on his wedding-day at night.
BOTTOM:
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then
read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
QUINCE:
Marry, our play is 'The most Lamentable Comedy and most
Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.'
BOTTOM:
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now,
good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters,
spread yourselves.
QUINCE:
Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
BOTTOM:
Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
QUINCE:
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
BOTTOM:
What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
QUINCE:
A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
BOTTOM:
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I
do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms; I
will condole in some measure. To the rest- yet my chief humour is
for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat
in, to make all split.
This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is
Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein: a lover is more condoling.
QUINCE:
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
FLUTE:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
FLUTE:
What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
QUINCE:
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
FLUTE:
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
QUINCE:
That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may
speak as small as you will.
BOTTOM:
An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too.
I'll speak in a monstrous little voice: 'Thisne, Thisne!'
Thisby dear, and lady dear!'
QUINCE:
No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.
BOTTOM:
Well, proceed.
QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, the tailor.
STARVELING:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.
SNOUT:
Here, Peter Quince.
QUINCE:
You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father; Snug, the
joiner, you, the lion's part. And, I hope, here is a play fitted.
SNUG:
Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it
me, for I am slow of study.
QUINCE:
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
BOTTOM:
Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any
man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the
Duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'
QUINCE:
An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the
Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were
enough to hang us all.
ALL:
That would hang us, every mother's son.
BOTTOM:
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out
of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us;
but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently
as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.
QUINCE:
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-fac'd man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must needs
play Pyramus.
BOTTOM:
Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play
it in?
QUINCE:
Why, what you will.
BOTTOM:
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your
orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your
French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.
QUINCE:
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then
you will play bare-fac'd. But, masters, here are your parts; and
I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by
to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without
the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in
the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our devices known.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our
play wants. I pray you, fail me not.
BOTTOM:
We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and
courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.
QUINCE:
At the Duke's oak we meet.
BOTTOM:
Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings.
PUCK:
How now, spirit! whither wander you?
FAIRY:
Over hill, over dale,
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone.
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
PUCK:
The King doth keep his revels here to-night;
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.
FAIRY:
Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery,
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
Are not you he?
PUCK:
Thou speakest aright:
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But room, fairy, here comes Oberon.
FAIRY:
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
OBERON:
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
TITANIA:
What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;
I have forsworn his bed and company.
OBERON:
Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
TITANIA:
Then I must be thy lady; but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steep of India,
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity?
OBERON:
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigouna, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?
TITANIA:
These are the forgeries of jealousy;
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
Hath every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents.
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest;
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound.
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which.
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.
OBERON:
Do you amend it, then; it lies in you.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy
To be my henchman.
TITANIA:
Set your heart at rest;
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a vot'ress of my order;
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side;
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking th' embarked traders on the flood;
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following- her womb then rich with my young squire-
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy;
And for her sake I will not part with him.
OBERON:
How long within this wood intend you stay?
TITANIA:
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round,
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
OBERON:
Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
TITANIA:
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.
We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
OBERON:
Well, go thy way; thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb'rest
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
To hear the sea-maid's music.
PUCK:
I remember.
OBERON:
That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Flying between the cold moon and the earth
Cupid, all arm'd; a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal, throned by the west,
And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon;
And the imperial vot'ress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it Love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flow'r, the herb I showed thee once.
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
PUCK:
I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.
OBERON:
Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes;
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.
DEMETRIUS:
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood,
And here am I, and wood within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
HELENA:
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.
DEMETRIUS:
Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?
HELENA:
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,
And yet a place of high respect with me,
Than to be used as you use your dog?
DEMETRIUS:
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
HELENA:
And I am sick when I look not on you.
DEMETRIUS:
You do impeach your modesty too much
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.
HELENA:
Your virtue is my privilege for that:
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you, in my respect, are all the world.
Then how can it be said I am alone
When all the world is here to look on me?
DEMETRIUS:
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
HELENA:
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will; the story shall be chang'd:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
DEMETRIUS:
I will not stay thy questions; let me go;
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
HELENA:
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
We cannot fight for love as men may do;
We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
OBERON:
Fare thee well, nymph; ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
PUCK:
Ay, there it is.
OBERON:
I pray thee give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine;
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love.
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
PUCK:
Fear not, my lord; your servant shall do so.
TITANIA:
Come now, a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence:
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats; and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices, and let me rest.
FIRST FAIRY:
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
CHORUS:
Philomel with melody
SECOND FAIRY:
Weaving spiders, come not here;
CHORUS:
Philomel with melody, etc.
FIRST FAIRY:
Hence away; now all is well.
OBERON:
What thou seest when thou dost wake,
Do it for thy true-love take;
Love and languish for his sake.
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear.
Wake when some vile thing is near.
LYSANDER:
Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood;
And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.
HERMIA:
Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,
For I upon this bank will rest my head.
LYSANDER:
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
HERMIA:
Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet; do not lie so near.
LYSANDER:
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit,
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath,
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny,
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
HERMIA:
Lysander riddles very prettily.
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off, in human modesty;
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
LYSANDER:
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed; sleep give thee all his rest!
HERMIA:
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
PUCK:
Through the forest have I gone,
HELENA:
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
DEMETRIUS:
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
HELENA:
O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.
DEMETRIUS:
Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.
HELENA:
O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies,
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;
If so, my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear,
For beasts that meet me run away for fear;
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.
LYSANDER:
[Waking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
HELENA:
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so.
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.
LYSANDER:
Content with Hermia! No: I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd,
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories, written in Love's richest book.
HELENA:
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well; perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady of one man refus'd
Should of another therefore be abus'd!
LYSANDER:
She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there;
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
Or as the heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!
HERMIA:
[Starting] Help me, Lysander, help me; do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.
Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
Lysander! What, remov'd? Lysander! lord!
What, out of hearing gone? No sound, no word?
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
BOTTOM:
Are we all met?
QUINCE:
Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our
rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn
brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will
do it before the Duke.
BOTTOM:
Peter Quince!
QUINCE:
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
BOTTOM:
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that
will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill
himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
SNOUT:
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
STARVELING:
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
done.
BOTTOM:
Not a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a
prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed; and for
the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not
Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.
QUINCE:
Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written
in eight and six.
BOTTOM:
No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
SNOUT:
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
STARVELING:
I fear it, I promise you.
BOTTOM:
Masters, you ought to consider with yourself to bring in-
God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing; for
there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and
we ought to look to't.
SNOUT:
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
BOTTOM:
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen
through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,
saying thus, or to the same defect: 'Ladies,' or 'Fair ladies, I
would wish you' or 'I would request you' or 'I would entreat you
not to fear, not to tremble. My life for yours! If you think I
come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such
thing; I am a man as other men are.' And there, indeed, let him
name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
QUINCE:
Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things- that
is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus
and Thisby meet by moonlight.
SNOUT:
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
BOTTOM:
A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out
moonshine, find out moonshine.
QUINCE:
Yes, it doth shine that night.
BOTTOM:
Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the
casement.
QUINCE:
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person
of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in
the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.
SNOUT:
You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
BOTTOM:
Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some
plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify
wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny
shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
QUINCE:
If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every
mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin; when
you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every
one according to his cue.
PUCK:
What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here,
So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
QUINCE:
Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
BOTTOM:
Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet-
QUINCE:
'Odious'- odorous!
BOTTOM:
-odours savours sweet;
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile,
And by and by I will to thee appear.
PUCK:
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here!
FLUTE:
Must I speak now?
QUINCE:
Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to
see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
FLUTE:
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
QUINCE:
'Ninus' tomb,' man! Why, you must not speak that yet; that
you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and
all. Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is 'never tire.'
FLUTE:
O- As true as truest horse, that y et would never tire.
BOTTOM:
If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
QUINCE:
O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters! fly,
masters! Help!
PUCK:
I'll follow you; I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier;
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
BOTTOM:
Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me
afeard.
SNOUT:
O Bottom, thou art chang'd! What do I see on thee?
BOTTOM:
What do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?
QUINCE:
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art translated.
BOTTOM:
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to
fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do
what they can; I will walk up and down here, and will sing, that
they shall hear I am not afraid.
TITANIA:
What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed?
BOTTOM:
[Sings]
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
Who would give a bird the he, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so?
TITANIA:
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
BOTTOM:
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company
together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest
neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon
occasion.
TITANIA:
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
BOTTOM:
Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this
wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
TITANIA:
Out of this wood do not desire to go;
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee; therefore, go with me.
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.
COBWEB:
And I.
MOTH:
And I.
MUSTARDSEED:
And I.
ALL:
Where shall we go?
TITANIA:
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Hail, mortal!
COBWEB:
Hail!
MOTH:
Hail!
MUSTARDSEED:
Hail!
BOTTOM:
I cry your worships mercy, heartily; I beseech your
worship's name.
COBWEB:
Cobweb.
BOTTOM:
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your
name, honest gentleman?
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Peaseblossom.
BOTTOM:
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and
to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall
desire you of more acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you,
sir?
MUSTARDSEED:
Mustardseed.
BOTTOM:
Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well. That
same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devour'd many a gentleman
of your house. I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water
ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
Mustardseed.
TITANIA:
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon, methinks, looks with a wat'ry eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower;
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
OBERON:
I wonder if Titania be awak'd;
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit!
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
PUCK:
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day.
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake;
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head.
Anon his Thisby must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So at his sight away his fellows fly;
And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there;
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania wak'd, and straightway lov'd an ass.
OBERON:
This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
PUCK:
I took him sleeping- that is finish'd too-
And the Athenian woman by his side;
That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd.
OBERON:
Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
PUCK:
This is the woman, but not this the man.
DEMETRIUS:
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
HERMIA:
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me. Would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murd'red him;
So should a murderer look- so dead, so grim.
DEMETRIUS:
So should the murdered look; and so should I,
Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty;
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
HERMIA:
What's this to my Lysander? Where is he?
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
DEMETRIUS:
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
HERMIA:
Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never numb'red among men!
O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
DEMETRIUS:
You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
HERMIA:
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
DEMETRIUS:
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
HERMIA:
A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so;
See me no more whether he be dead or no.
DEMETRIUS:
There is no following her in this fierce vein;
Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.
OBERON:
What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
PUCK:
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
OBERON:
About the wood go swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find;
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.
By some illusion see thou bring her here;
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
PUCK:
I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
OBERON:
Flower of this purple dye,
PUCK:
Captain of our fairy band,
OBERON:
Stand aside. The noise they make
PUCK:
Then will two at once woo one.
LYSANDER:
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears.
Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
HELENA:
You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's. Will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.
LYSANDER:
I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
HELENA:
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
LYSANDER:
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
DEMETRIUS:
[Awaking] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
When thou hold'st up thy hand. O, let me kiss
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
HELENA:
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment.
If you were civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so:
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! None of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
LYSANDER:
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia. This you know I know;
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.
HELENA:
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.
If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.
LYSANDER:
Helen, it is not so.
DEMETRIUS:
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
HERMIA:
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
LYSANDER:
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
HERMIA:
What love could press Lysander from my side?
LYSANDER:
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide-
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?
HERMIA:
You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
HELENA:
Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us- O, is all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key;
As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition,
Two lovely berries moulded on one stern;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly;
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.
HERMIA:
I am amazed at your passionate words;
I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.
HELENA:
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
This you should pity rather than despise.
HERMIA:
I understand not what you mean by this.
HELENA:
Ay, do- persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up;
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well; 'tis partly my own fault,
Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.
LYSANDER:
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
HELENA:
O excellent!
HERMIA:
Sweet, do not scorn her so.
DEMETRIUS:
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
LYSANDER:
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
Helen, I love thee, by my life I do;
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
DEMETRIUS:
I say I love thee more than he can do.
LYSANDER:
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
DEMETRIUS:
Quick, come.
HERMIA:
Lysander, whereto tends all this?
LYSANDER:
Away, you Ethiope!
DEMETRIUS:
No, no, he will
Seem to break loose- take on as you would follow,
But yet come not. You are a tame man; go!
LYSANDER:
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr; vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
HERMIA:
Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
Sweet love?
LYSANDER:
Thy love! Out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed med'cine! O hated potion, hence!
HERMIA:
Do you not jest?
HELENA:
Yes, sooth; and so do you.
LYSANDER:
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
DEMETRIUS:
I would I had your bond; for I perceive
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
LYSANDER:
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
HERMIA:
What! Can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?
Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me.
Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!-
In earnest, shall I say?
LYSANDER:
Ay, by my life!
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
HERMIA:
O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
You thief of love! What! Have you come by night,
And stol'n my love's heart from him?
HELENA:
Fine, i' faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What! Will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet you!
HERMIA:
'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urg'd her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak.
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
HELENA:
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice;
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.
HERMIA:
'Lower' hark, again.
HELENA:
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He followed you; for love I followed him;
But he hath chid me hence, and threat'ned me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too;
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back,
And follow you no further. Let me go.
You see how simple and how fond I am.
HERMIA:
Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
HELENA:
A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
HERMIA:
What! with Lysander?
HELENA:
With Demetrius.
LYSANDER:
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
DEMETRIUS:
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
HELENA:
O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd;
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And, though she be but little, she is fierce.
HERMIA:
'Little' again! Nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.
LYSANDER:
Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hind'ring knot-grass made;
You bead, you acorn.
DEMETRIUS:
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone; speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
LYSANDER:
Now she holds me not.
Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
DEMETRIUS:
Follow! Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
HERMIA:
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Nay, go not back.
HELENA:
I will not trust you, I;
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
My legs are longer though, to run away.
HERMIA:
I am amaz'd, and know not what to say.
OBERON:
This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak'st,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
PUCK:
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garments he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort,
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
OBERON:
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
PUCK:
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,
At whose approach ghosts, wand'ring here and there,
Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all
That in cross-ways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
For fear lest day should look their shames upon;
They wilfully themselves exil'd from light,
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
OBERON:
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the Morning's love have oft made sport;
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;
We may effect this business yet ere day.
PUCK:
Up and down, up and down,
Here comes one.
LYSANDER:
Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.
PUCK:
Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
LYSANDER:
I will be with thee straight.
PUCK:
Follow me, then,
To plainer ground.
DEMETRIUS:
Lysander, speak again.
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
PUCK:
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
That draws a sword on thee.
DEMETRIUS:
Yea, art thou there?
PUCK:
Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
LYSANDER:
He goes before me, and still dares me on;
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
The villain is much lighter heel'd than I.
I followed fast, but faster he did fly,
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day.
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.
PUCK:
Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?
DEMETRIUS:
Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot
Thou run'st before me, shifting every place,
And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?
PUCK:
Come hither; I am here.
DEMETRIUS:
Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see;
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.
HELENA:
O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
From these that my poor company detest.
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
PUCK:
Yet but three? Come one more;
HERMIA:
Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers,
I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
PUCK:
On the ground
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
TITANIA:
Come, sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
BOTTOM:
Where's Peaseblossom?
PEASEBLOSSOM:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
COBWEB:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Mounsieur Cobweb; good mounsieur, get you your weapons in
your hand and kill me a red-hipp'd humble-bee on the top of a
thistle; and, good mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and, good mounsieur,
have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you
overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur
Mustardseed?
MUSTARDSEED:
Ready.
BOTTOM:
Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, leave
your curtsy, good mounsieur.
MUSTARDSEED:
What's your will?
BOTTOM:
Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to
scratch. I must to the barber's, mounsieur; for methinks I am
marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if
my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
TITANIA:
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
BOTTOM:
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs
and the bones.
TITANIA:
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
BOTTOM:
Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry
oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay. Good
hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
TITANIA:
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
BOTTOM:
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I
pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition
of sleep come upon me.
TITANIA:
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gently entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
OBERON:
[Advancing] Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet
Her dotage now I do begin to pity;
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her and fall out with her.
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes,
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
I then did ask of her her changeling child;
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain,
That he awaking when the other do
May all to Athens back again repair,
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the Fairy Queen.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
TITANIA:
My Oberon! What visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
OBERON:
There lies your love.
TITANIA:
How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
OBERON:
Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
TITANIA:
Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!
PUCK:
Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep.
OBERON:
Sound, music. Come, my Queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity.
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, an in jollity.
PUCK:
Fairy King, attend and mark;
OBERON:
Then, my Queen, in silence sad,
TITANIA:
Come, my lord; and in our flight,
THESEUS:
Go, one of you, find out the forester;
For now our observation is perform'd,
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go.
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
We will, fair Queen, up to the mountain's top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
HIPPOLYTA:
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta; never did I hear
Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry. I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
THESEUS:
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.
Judge when you hear. But, soft, what nymphs are these?
EGEUS:
My lord, this is my daughter here asleep,
And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena.
I wonder of their being here together.
THESEUS:
No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May; and, hearing our intent,
Came here in grace of our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
EGEUS:
It is, my lord.
THESEUS:
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
Good-morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past;
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
LYSANDER:
Pardon, my lord.
THESEUS:
I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies;
How comes this gentle concord in the world
That hatred is so far from jealousy
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
LYSANDER:
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here,
But, as I think- for truly would I speak,
And now I do bethink me, so it is-
I came with Hermia hither. Our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
Without the peril of the Athenian law-
EGEUS:
Enough, enough, my Lord; you have enough;
I beg the law, the law upon his head.
They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me:
You of your wife, and me of my consent,
Of my consent that she should be your wife.
DEMETRIUS:
My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
And I in fury hither followed them,
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power-
But by some power it is- my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia.
But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.
THESEUS:
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will;
For in the temple, by and by, with us
These couples shall eternally be knit.
And, for the morning now is something worn,
Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
Away with us to Athens, three and three;
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Come, Hippolyta.
DEMETRIUS:
These things seem small and undistinguishable,
Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
HERMIA:
Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every thing seems double.
HELENA:
So methinks;
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.
DEMETRIUS:
Are you sure
That we are awake? It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?
HERMIA:
Yea, and my father.
HELENA:
And Hippolyta.
LYSANDER:
And he did bid us follow to the temple.
DEMETRIUS:
Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
And by the way let us recount our dreams.
BOTTOM:
[Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My
next is 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the
bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God's my life,
stol'n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was.
Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought
I was- there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and
methought I had, but man is but a patch'd fool, if he will offer
to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the
ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his
tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I
will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall
be call'd 'Bottom's Dream,' because it hath no bottom; and I will
sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at
her death.
QUINCE:
Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
STARVELING:
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
FLUTE:
If he come not, then the play is marr'd; it goes not
forward, doth it?
QUINCE:
It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able
to discharge Pyramus but he.
FLUTE:
No; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
Athens.
QUINCE:
Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for
a sweet voice.
FLUTE:
You must say 'paragon.' A paramour is- God bless us!- A
thing of naught.
SNUG:
Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is two
or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone
forward, we had all been made men.
FLUTE:
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
during his life; he could not have scaped sixpence a day. An the
Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll
be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus,
or nothing.
BOTTOM:
Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
QUINCE:
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
BOTTOM:
Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what;
for if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you
everything, right as it fell out.
QUINCE:
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
BOTTOM:
Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the
Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together; good strings to your
beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace;
every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
play is preferr'd. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and
let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall
hang out for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no
onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not
doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more words.
Away, go, away!
HIPPOLYTA:
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
THESEUS:
More strange than true. I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
Are of imagination all compact.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination
That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear?
HIPPOLYTA:
But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images,
And grows to something of great constancy,
But howsoever strange and admirable.
THESEUS:
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts!
LYSANDER:
More than to us
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
THESEUS:
Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
To wear away this long age of three hours
Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand? Is there no play
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.
PHILOSTRATE:
Here, mighty Theseus.
THESEUS:
Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time, if not with some delight?
PHILOSTRATE:
There is a brief how many sports are ripe;
Make choice of which your Highness will see first.
THESEUS:
'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
That is an old device, and it was play'd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary.'
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.'
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
PHILOSTRATE:
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.
THESEUS:
What are they that do play it?
PHILOSTRATE:
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never labour'd in their minds till now;
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
With this same play against your nuptial.
THESEUS:
And we will hear it.
PHILOSTRATE:
No, my noble lord,
It is not for you. I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
To do you service.
THESEUS:
I will hear that play;
For never anything can be amiss
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in; and take your places, ladies.
HIPPOLYTA:
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
And duty in his service perishing.
THESEUS:
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
HIPPOLYTA:
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
THESEUS:
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,
And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most to my capacity.
PHILOSTRATE:
SO please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
THESEUS:
Let him approach.
PROLOGUE:
If we offend, it is with our good will.
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then, we come but in despite.
We do not come, as minding to content you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at band; and, by their show,
You shall know all, that you are like to know,
THESEUS:
This fellow doth not stand upon points.
LYSANDER:
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not
the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but
to speak true.
HIPPOLYTA:
Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a
recorder- a sound, but not in government.
THESEUS:
His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing im paired,
but all disordered. Who is next?
PROLOGUE:
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
At large discourse while here they do remain.
THESEUS:
I wonder if the lion be to speak.
DEMETRIUS:
No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
WALL:
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so;
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
THESEUS:
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
DEMETRIUS:
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse, my lord.
THESEUS:
Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
PYRAMUS:
O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,
Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me!
THESEUS:
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
PYRAMUS:
No, in truth, sir, he should not. Deceiving me is Thisby's
cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.
You shall see it will fall pat as I told you; yonder she comes.
THISBY:
O wall, full often hast thou beard my moans,
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
PYRAMUS:
I see a voice; now will I to the chink,
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.
Thisby!
THISBY:
My love! thou art my love, I think.
PYRAMUS:
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And like Limander am I trusty still.
THISBY:
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
PYRAMUS:
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
THISBY:
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
PYRAMUS:
O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
THISBY:
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
PYRAMUS:
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
THISBY:
Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
WALL:
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
THESEUS:
Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
DEMETRIUS:
No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning.
HIPPOLYTA:
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
THESEUS:
The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are
no worse, if imagination amend them.
HIPPOLYTA:
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
THESEUS:
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,
they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a
man and a lion.
LION:
You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
Then know that I as Snug the joiner am
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
For, if I should as lion come in strife
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
THESEUS:
A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
DEMETRIUS:
The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
LYSANDER:
This lion is a very fox for his valour.
THESEUS:
True; and a goose for his discretion.
DEMETRIUS:
Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
THESEUS:
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for
the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his
discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.
MOONSHINE:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
DEMETRIUS:
He should have worn the horns on his head.
THESEUS:
He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the
circumference.
MOONSHINE:
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
Myself the Man i' th' Moon do seem to be.
THESEUS:
This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should
be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' th' moon?
DEMETRIUS:
He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it
is already in snuff.
HIPPOLYTA:
I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
THESEUS:
It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is
in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay
the time.
LYSANDER:
Proceed, Moon.
MOON:
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is
the moon; I, the Man i' th' Moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush;
and this dog, my dog.
DEMETRIUS:
Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all these
are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisby.
THISBY:
This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
LION:
[Roaring] O-
DEMETRIUS:
Well roar'd, Lion.
THESEUS:
Well run, Thisby.
HIPPOLYTA:
Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good
grace.
THESEUS:
Well mous'd, Lion.
DEMETRIUS:
And then came Pyramus.
LYSANDER:
And so the lion vanish'd.
PYRAMUS:
Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
For, by thy gracious golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
THESEUS:
This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go
near to make a man look sad.
HIPPOLYTA:
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
PYRAMUS:
O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
Which is- no, no- which was the fairest dame
That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.
DEMETRIUS:
No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
LYSANDER:
Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
THESEUS:
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet
prove an ass.
HIPPOLYTA:
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back
and finds her lover?
THESEUS:
She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her
passion ends the play.
HIPPOLYTA:
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus; I hope she will be brief.
DEMETRIUS:
A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
Thisby, is the better- he for a man, God warrant us: She for a
woman, God bless us!
LYSANDER:
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
DEMETRIUS:
And thus she moans, videlicet:-
THISBY:
Asleep, my love?
THESEUS:
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
DEMETRIUS:
Ay, and Wall too.
BOTTOM:
[Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?
THESEUS:
No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse.
Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need none
to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus, and
hang'd himself in Thisby's garter, it would have been a fine
tragedy. And so it is, truly; and very notably discharg'd. But
come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
In nightly revels and new jollity.
PUCK:
Now the hungry lion roars,
OBERON:
Through the house give glimmering light,
TITANIA:
First, rehearse your song by rote,
OBERON:
Now, until the break of day,
PUCK:
If we shadows have offended,
LEON:
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this
night to Messina.
MESS:
He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I
left him.
LEON:
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
MESS:
But few of any sort, and none of name.
LEON:
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young Florentine called Claudio.
MESS:
Much deserv'd on his part, and equally rememb'red by Don
Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed
better bett'red expectation than you must expect of me to tell
you how.
LEON:
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
MESS:
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much
joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness.
LEON:
Did he break out into tears?
MESS:
In great measure.
LEON:
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than
those that are so wash'd. How much better is it to weep at joy
than to joy at weeping!
BEAT:
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from the wars or no?
MESS:
I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the
army of any sort.
LEON:
What is he that you ask for, niece?
HERO:
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
MESS:
O, he's return'd, and as pleasant as ever he was.
BEAT:
He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng'd Cupid at
the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge,
subscrib'd for Cupid and challeng'd him at the burbolt. I pray
you, how many hath he kill'd and eaten in these wars? But how
many hath he kill'd? For indeed I promised to eat all of his
killing.
LEON:
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he'll
be meet with you, I doubt it not.
MESS:
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
BEAT:
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a
very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.
MESS:
And a good soldier too, lady.
BEAT:
And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
MESS:
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuff'd with all honourable
virtues.
BEAT:
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuff'd man; but for
the stuffing--well, we are all mortal.
LEON:
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry
war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there's
a skirmish of wit between them.
BEAT:
Alas, he gets nothing by that! In our last conflict four of
his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern'd
with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new
sworn brother.
MESS:
Is't possible?
BEAT:
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion
of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
MESS:
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
BEAT:
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is
his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil?
MESS:
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
BEAT:
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner
caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God
help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will
cost him a thousand pound ere 'a be cured.
MESS:
I will hold friends with you, lady.
BEAT:
Do, good friend.
LEON:
You will never run mad, niece.
BEAT:
No, not till a hot January.
MESS:
Don Pedro is approach'd.
PEDRO:
Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The
fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.
LEON:
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace;
for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart
from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.
PEDRO:
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your
daughter.
LEON:
Her mother hath many times told me so.
BENE:
Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask'd her?
LEON:
Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
PEDRO:
You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you
are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady;
for you are like an honourable father.
BENE:
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
BEAT:
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick.
Nobody marks you.
BENE:
What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
BEAT:
Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert
to disdain if you come in her presence.
BENE:
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my
heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
BEAT:
A dear happiness to women! They would else have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of
your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.
BENE:
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman
or other shall scape a predestinate scratch'd face.
BEAT:
Scratching could not make it worse an 'twere such a face as
yours were.
BENE:
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
BEAT:
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
BENE:
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a
continuer. But keep your way, a God's name! I have done.
BEAT:
You always end with a jade's trick. I know you of old.
PEDRO:
That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio and Signior
Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him
we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays
some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
LEON:
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To Don
John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled to the
Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
JOHN:
I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.
LEON:
Please it your Grace lead on?
PEDRO:
Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.
CLAUD:
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
BENE:
I noted her not, but I look'd on her.
CLAUD:
Is she not a modest young lady?
BENE:
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple
true judgment? or would you have me speak after my custom, as
being a professed tyrant to their sex?
CLAUD:
No. I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
BENE:
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,
too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise.
Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other
than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she
is, I do not like her.
CLAUD:
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how
thou lik'st her.
BENE:
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
CLAUD:
Can the world buy such a jewel?
BENE:
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad
brow? or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a
good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key
shall a man take you to go in the song?
CLAUD:
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I look'd on.
BENE:
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
There's her cousin, an she were not possess'd with a fury,exceeds
her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of
December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have
you?
CLAUD:
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
BENE:
Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but
he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a
bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i' faith! An thou wilt needs
thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays.
Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
PEDRO:
What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to
Leonato's?
BENE:
I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.
PEDRO:
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
BENE:
You hear, Count Claudio. I can be secret as a dumb man, I
would have you think so; but, on my allegiance--mark you this-on
my allegiance! he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace's
part. Mark how short his answer is: With Hero, Leonato's short
daughter.
CLAUD:
If this were so, so were it utt'red.
BENE:
Like the old tale, my lord: 'It is not so, nor 'twas not so;
but indeed, God forbid it should be so!'
CLAUD:
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be
otherwise.
PEDRO:
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
CLAUD:
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
PEDRO:
By my troth, I speak my thought.
CLAUD:
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
BENE:
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
CLAUD:
That I love her, I feel.
PEDRO:
That she is worthy, I know.
BENE:
That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she
should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me.
I will die in it at the stake.
PEDRO:
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of
beauty.
CLAUD:
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his
will.
BENE:
That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me
up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have
a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible
baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them
the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust
none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will
live a bachelor.
PEDRO:
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
BENE:
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with
love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get
again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen
and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of
blind Cupid.
PEDRO:
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt
prove a notable argument.
BENE:
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and
he that hits me, let him be clapp'd on the shoulder and call'd
Adam.
PEDRO:
Well, as time shall try.
'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.'
BENE:
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead, and
let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write
'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
CLAUD:
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
PEDRO:
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou
wilt quake for this shortly.
BENE:
I look for an earthquake too then.
PEDRO:
Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime,
good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's, commend me to him and
tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.
BENE:
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and
so I commit you--
CLAUD:
To the tuition of God. From my house--if I had it--
PEDRO:
The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.
BENE:
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is
sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly
basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine
your conscience. And so I leave you.
CLAUD:
My liege, your Highness now may do me good.
PEDRO:
My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
CLAUD:
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
PEDRO:
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
CLAUD:
O my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
That lik'd, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love;
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying I lik'd her ere I went to wars.
PEDRO:
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Wast not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
CLAUD:
How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salv'd it with a longer treatise.
PEDRO:
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night.
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale.
Then after to her father will I break,
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practice let us put it presently.
LEON:
How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he
provided this music?
ANT:
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
news that you yet dreamt not of.
LEON:
Are they good?
ANT:
As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they
show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a
thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by
a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a
dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the
present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.
LEON:
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
ANT:
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him
yourself.
LEON:
No, no. We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but
I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better
prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and
tell her of it.
and I will use your skill.--Good cousin, have a care this busy
time.
CON:
What the goodyear, my lord! Why are you thus out of measure
sad?
JOHN:
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore
the sadness is without limit.
CON:
You should hear reason.
JOHN:
And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?
CON:
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
JOHN:
I wonder that thou (being, as thou say'st thou art, born
under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when
I have cause, and smile at no man's jests; eat when I have
stomach, and wait for no man's leisure; sleep when I am drowsy,
and tend on no man's business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no
man in his humour.
CON:
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against
your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace, where
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest.
JOHN:
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,
and it better fits my blood to be disdain'd of all than to
fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but
I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and
enfranchis'd with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in
my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I
would do my liking. In the meantime let me be that I am, and seek
not to alter me.
CON:
Can you make no use of your discontent?
JOHN:
I make all use of it, for I use it only.
Who comes here? What news, Borachio?
BORA:
I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is
royally entertain'd by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.
JOHN:
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
BORA:
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
JOHN:
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
BORA:
Even he.
JOHN:
A proper squire! And who? and who? which way looks he?
BORA:
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
JOHN:
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
BORA:
Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty
room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad
conference. I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed
upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtain'd her, give her to Count Claudio.
JOHN:
Come, come, let us thither. This may prove food to my
displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my
overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.
You are both sure, and will assist me?
CON:
To the death, my lord.
JOHN:
Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the greater that
I am subdued. Would the cook were o' my mind! Shall we go prove
what's to be done?
BORA:
We'll wait upon your lordship.
LEON:
Was not Count John here at supper?
ANT:
I saw him not.
BEAT:
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am
heart-burn'd an hour after.
HERO:
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
BEAT:
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick. The one is too like an image and says
nothing, and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore
tattling.
LEON:
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth,
and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face--
BEAT:
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in
his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world--if 'a
could get her good will.
LEON:
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
ANT:
In faith, she's too curst.
BEAT:
Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God's sending
that way, for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns,'
but to a cow too curst he sends none.
LEON:
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
BEAT:
Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am
at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not
endure a husband with a beard on his face. I had rather lie in
the woollen!
LEON:
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
BEAT:
What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make
him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a
youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that
is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in
earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell.
LEON:
Well then, go you into hell?
BEAT:
No; but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an
old cuckold with horns on his head, and say 'Get you to heaven,
Beatrice, get you to heaven. Here's no place for you maids.' So
deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter--for the heavens.
He shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry
as the day is long.
ANT:
[to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
father.
BEAT:
Yes faith. It is my cousin's duty to make cursy and say,
'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all that, cousin, let him
be a handsome fellow, or else make another cursy, and say,
'Father, as it please me.'
LEON:
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
BEAT:
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would
it not grieve a woman to be overmaster'd with a piece of valiant
dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I'll none. Adam's sons are my brethren, and truly I
hold it a sin to match in my kinred.
LEON:
Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit
you in that kind, you know your answer.
BEAT:
The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed
in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is
measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me,
Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a
measure, and a cinque-pace: the first suit is hot and hasty like
a Scotch jig--and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly
modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace
faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
LEON:
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
BEAT:
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
LEON:
The revellers are ent'ring, brother. Make good room.
Enter, Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Balthasar.
PEDRO:
Lady, will you walk a bout with your friend?
HERO:
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
PEDRO:
With me in your company?
HERO:
I may say so when I please.
PEDRO:
And when please you to say so?
HERO:
When I like your favour, for God defend the lute should be
like the case!
PEDRO:
My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
HERO:
Why then, your visor should be thatch'd.
PEDRO:
Speak low if you speak love.
BALTH:
Well, I would you did like me.
MARG:
So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill
qualities.
BALTH:
Which is one?
MARG:
I say my prayers aloud.
BALTH:
I love you the better. The hearers may cry Amen.
MARG:
God match me with a good dancer!
BALTH:
Amen.
MARG:
And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done!
Answer, clerk.
BALTH:
No more words. The clerk is answered.
URS:
I know you well enough. You are Signior Antonio.
ANT:
At a word, I am not.
URS:
I know you by the waggling of your head.
ANT:
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
URS:
You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very
man. Here's his dry hand up and down. You are he, you are he!
ANT:
At a word, I am not.
URS:
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent
wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum you are he. Graces will
appear, and there's an end.
BEAT:
Will you not tell me who told you so?
BENE:
No, you shall pardon me.
BEAT:
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
BENE:
Not now.
BEAT:
That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the
'Hundred Merry Tales.' Well, this was Signior Benedick that said
so.
BENE:
What's he?
BEAT:
I am sure you know him well enough.
BENE:
Not I, believe me.
BEAT:
Did he never make you laugh?
BENE:
I pray you, what is he?
BEAT:
Why, he is the Prince's jester, a very dull fool. Only his
gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines
delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in
his villany; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet.
I would he had boarded me.
BENE:
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
BEAT:
Do, do. He'll but break a comparison or two on me; which
peradventure, not marked or not laugh'd at, strikes him into
melancholy; and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool
will eat no supper that night.
We must follow the leaders.
BENE:
In every good thing.
BEAT:
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next
turning.
JOHN:
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her
father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but
one visor remains.
BORA:
And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing.
JOHN:
Are you not Signior Benedick?
CLAUD:
You know me well. I am he.
JOHN:
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love. He is
enamour'd on Hero. I pray you dissuade him from her; she is no
equal for his birth. You may do the part of an honest man in it.
CLAUD:
How know you he loves her?
JOHN:
I heard him swear his affection.
BORA:
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
JOHN:
Come, let us to the banquet.
CLAUD:
Thus answer I in name of Benedick
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love.
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero!
BENE:
Count Claudio?
CLAUD:
Yea, the same.
BENE:
Come, will you go with me?
CLAUD:
Whither?
BENE:
Even to the next willow, about your own business, County. What
fashion will you wear the garland of? about your neck, like an
usurer's chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You
must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.
CLAUD:
I wish him joy of her.
BENE:
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier. So they sell
bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you
thus?
CLAUD:
I pray you leave me.
BENE:
Ho! now you strike like the blind man! 'Twas the boy that
stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
CLAUD:
If it will not be, I'll leave you.
BENE:
Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges. But,
that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The
Prince's fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am
merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so
reputed. It is the base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Well,
I'll be revenged as I may.
PEDRO:
Now, signior, where's the Count? Did you see him?
BENE:
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame, I found
him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I
think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of
this young lady, and I off'red him my company to a willow tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him
up a rod, as being worthy to be whipt.
PEDRO:
To be whipt? What's his fault?
BENE:
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed
with finding a bird's nest, shows it his companion, and he steals
it.
PEDRO:
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is
in the stealer.
BENE:
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the
garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the
rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stol'n
his bird's nest.
PEDRO:
I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner.
BENE:
If their singing answer your saying, by my faith you say
honestly.
PEDRO:
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that
danc'd with her told her she is much wrong'd by you.
BENE:
O, she misus'd me past the end
RODERIGO:
Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
IAGO:
'Sblood, but you will not hear me.
If ever I did dream of such a matter,
Abhor me.
RODERIGO:
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
IAGO:
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bumbast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, "Certes," says he,
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election;
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be belee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship's ancient.
RODERIGO:
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
IAGO:
Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service,
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.
RODERIGO:
I would not follow him then.
IAGO:
O, sir, content you.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That doting on his own obsequious bondage
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd.
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And throwing but shows of service on their lords
Do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,
And such a one do I profess myself.
For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end.
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In complement extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
RODERIGO:
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,
If he can carry't thus!
IAGO:
Call up her father,
Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't
As it may lose some color.
RODERIGO:
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
IAGO:
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.
RODERIGO:
What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
IAGO:
Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Thieves! Thieves!
BRABANTIO:
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?
RODERIGO:
Signior, is all your family within?
IAGO:
Are your doors lock'd?
BRABANTIO:
Why? Wherefore ask you this?
IAGO:
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd! For shame, put on your gown;
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Arise, I say!
BRABANTIO:
What, have you lost your wits?
RODERIGO:
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
BRABANTIO:
Not I. What are you?
RODERIGO:
My name is Roderigo.
BRABANTIO:
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.
RODERIGO:
Sir, sir, sir-
BRABANTIO:
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.
RODERIGO:
Patience, good sir.
BRABANTIO:
What tell'st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;
My house is not a grange.
RODERIGO:
Most grave Brabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you.
IAGO:
'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God,
if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you
think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a
Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.
BRABANTIO:
What profane wretch art thou?
IAGO:
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the
Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
BRABANTIO:
Thou are a villain.
IAGO:
You are- a senator.
BRABANTIO:
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
RODERIGO:
Sir, I will answer anything. But, I beseech you,
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-
If this be known to you, and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.
BRABANTIO:
Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream;
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!
IAGO:
Farewell, for I must leave you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be produced- as, if I stay, I shall-
Against the Moor; for I do know, the state,
However this may gall him with some check,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stands in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business; in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
Yet for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,
And there will I be with him. So farewell.
BRABANTIO:
It is too true an evil: gone she is,
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she? O, she deceives me
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers.
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
RODERIGO:
Truly, I think they are.
BRABANTIO:
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?
RODERIGO:
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
BRABANTIO:
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
RODERIGO:
I think I can discover him, if you please
To get good guard and go along with me.
BRABANTIO:
Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo, I'll deserve your pains.
IAGO:
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
To do no contrived murther. I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
OTHELLO:
'Tis better as it is.
IAGO:
Nay, but he prated
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honor
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
That the magnifico is much beloved,
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the Duke's. He will divorce you,
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Will give him cable.
OTHELLO:
Let him do his spite.
My services, which I have done the signiory,
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know-
Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
I shall promulgate- I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reach'd. For know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond?
IAGO:
Those are the raised father and his friends.
You were best go in.
OTHELLO:
Not I; I must be found.
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
IAGO:
By Janus, I think no.
OTHELLO:
The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?
CASSIO:
The Duke does greet you, general,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.
OTHELLO:
What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO:
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
It is a business of some heat. The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels;
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for,
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The Senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out.
OTHELLO:
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house
And go with you.
CASSIO:
Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO:
Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carack;
If it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.
CASSIO:
I do not understand.
IAGO:
He's married.
CASSIO:
To who?
IAGO:
Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO:
Have with you.
CASSIO:
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO:
It is Brabantio. General, be advised,
He comes to bad intent.
OTHELLO:
Holla! Stand there!
RODERIGO:
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO:
Down with him, thief!
IAGO:
You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO:
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Good signior, you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons.
BRABANTIO:
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou- to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion. I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practicer
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him. If he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.
OTHELLO:
Hold your hands,
Both you of my inclining and the rest.
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?
BRABANTIO:
To prison, till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.
OTHELLO:
What if I do obey?
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,
Whose messengers are here about my side,
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him?
FIRST OFFICER:
'Tis true, most worthy signior;
The Duke's in council, and your noble self,
I am sure, is sent for.
BRABANTIO:
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of the night? Bring him away;
Mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
DUKE:
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit.
FIRST SENATOR:
Indeed they are disproportion'd;
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
DUKE:
And mine, a hundred and forty.
SECOND SENATOR:
And mine, two hundred.
But though they jump not on a just account-
As in these cases, where the aim reports,
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
DUKE:
Nay, it is possible enough to judgement.
I do not so secure me in the error,
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense.
SAILOR:
[Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!
FIRST OFFICER:
A messenger from the galleys.
DUKE:
Now, what's the business?
SAILOR:
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo.
DUKE:
How say you by this change?
FIRST SENATOR:
This cannot be,
By no assay of reason; 'tis a pageant
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
And let ourselves again but understand
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
So may he with more facile question bear it,
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
But altogether lacks the abilities
That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
We must not think the Turk is so unskillful
To leave that latest which concerns him first,
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
To wake and wage a danger profitless.
DUKE:
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
FIRST OFFICER:
Here is more news.
MESSENGER:
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
FIRST SENATOR:
Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
MESSENGER:
Of thirty sail; and now they do re-stem
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
With his free duty recommends you thus,
And prays you to believe him.
DUKE:
'Tis certain then for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
FIRST SENATOR:
He's now in Florence.
DUKE:
Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.
FIRST SENATOR:
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
DUKE:
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman.
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
BRABANTIO:
So did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me:
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Take hold on me; for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,
And it is still itself.
DUKE:
Why, what's the matter?
BRABANTIO:
My daughter! O, my daughter!
ALL:
Dead?
BRABANTIO:
Ay, to me.
She is abused, stol'n from me and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.
DUKE:
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.
BRABANTIO:
Humbly I thank your Grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate for the state affairs
Hath hither brought.
ALL:
We are very sorry for't.
DUKE:
[To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?
BRABANTIO:
Nothing, but this is so.
OTHELLO:
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her;
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration, and what mighty magic-
For such proceeding I am charged withal-
I won his daughter.
BRABANTIO:
A maiden never bold,
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she- in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, everything-
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect,
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
To find out practices of cunning hell
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.
DUKE:
To vouch this is no proof,
Without more certain and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
FIRST SENATOR:
But, Othello, speak.
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request, and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?
OTHELLO:
I do beseech you,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
And let her speak of me before her father.
If you do find me foul in her report,
The trust, the office I do hold of you,
Not only take away, but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life.
DUKE:
Fetch Desdemona hither.
OTHELLO:
Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love
And she in mine.
DUKE:
Say it, Othello.
OTHELLO:
Her father loved me, oft invited me,
Still question'd me the story of my life
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have pass'd.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history;
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,
It was my hint to speak- such was the process-
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline;
But still the house affairs would draw her thence,
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively. I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That heaven had made her such a man; she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
DUKE:
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,
Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands.
BRABANTIO:
I pray you, hear her speak.
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress.
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?
DESDEMONA:
My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty.
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty,
I am hitherto your daughter. But here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor, my lord.
BRABANTIO:
God be with you! I have done.
Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs;
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor.
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
I am glad at soul I have no other child;
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
DUKE:
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
Into your favor.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes,
Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
BRABANTIO:
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears;
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
DUKE:
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and
though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency,
yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss
of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
expedition.
OTHELLO:
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
I crave fit disposition for my wife,
Due reference of place and exhibition,
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding.
DUKE:
If you please,
Be't at her father's.
BRABANTIO:
I'll not have it so.
OTHELLO:
Nor I.
DESDEMONA:
Nor I. I would not there reside
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious Duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,
And let me find a charter in your voice
To assist my simpleness.
DUKE:
What would you, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA:
That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord.
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honors and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
OTHELLO:
Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not
To please the palate of my appetite,
Nor to comply with heat- the young affects
In me defunct- and proper satisfaction;
But to be free and bounteous to her mind.
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me. No, when light-wing'd toys
Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments,
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation!
DUKE:
Be it as you shall privately determine,
Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,
And speed must answer't: you must hence tonight.
DESDEMONA:
Tonight, my lord?
DUKE:
This night.
OTHELLO:
With all my heart.
DUKE:
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
And he shall our commission bring to you,
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.
OTHELLO:
So please your Grace, my ancient;
A man he is of honesty and trust.
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
With what else needful your good Grace shall think
To be sent after me.
DUKE:
Let it be so.
Good night to everyone. And, noble signior,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
FIRST SENATOR:
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
BRABANTIO:
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see;
She has deceived her father, and may thee.
OTHELLO:
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her,
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
RODERIGO:
Iago!
IAGO:
What say'st thou, noble heart?
RODERIGO:
What will I do, thinkest thou?
IAGO:
Why, go to bed and sleep.
RODERIGO:
I will incontinently drown myself.
IAGO:
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
Why, thou silly gentleman!
RODERIGO:
It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
IAGO:
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I
would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I
would change my humanity with a baboon.
RODERIGO:
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
IAGO:
Virtue? a fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so
that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed
up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with
industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of
reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of
our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions.
But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings,
our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to
be a sect or scion.
RODERIGO:
It cannot be.
IAGO:
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind
puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to
thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou
the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurped beard. I say, put
money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long
continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his
to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an
answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse. These Moors
are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money. The
food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him
shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth;
when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her
choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in
thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate
way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony
and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle
Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell,
thou shalt enjoy her- therefore make money. A pox of drowning
thyself! It is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be
hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without
her.
RODERIGO:
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
IAGO:
Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often,
and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is
hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our
revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself
a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time
which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will
have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.
RODERIGO:
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
IAGO:
At my lodging.
RODERIGO:
I'll be with thee betimes.
IAGO:
Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
RODERIGO:
What say you?
IAGO:
No more of drowning, do you hear?
RODERIGO:
I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.
IAGO:
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane
If I would time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,
And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
He has done my office. I know not if't be true,
But I for mere suspicion in that kind
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well,
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man. Let me see now-
To get his place, and to plume up my will
In double knavery- How, how?- Let's see-
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected- framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
MONTANO:
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood;
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
Descry a sail.
MONTANO:
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood.
MONTANO:
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
It is impossible to bear it out.
THIRD GENTLEMAN:
News, lads! Our wars are done.
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet.
MONTANO:
How? Is this true?
THIRD GENTLEMAN:
The ship is here put in,
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor, Othello,
Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
MONTANO:
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
THIRD GENTLEMAN:
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest.
MONTANO:
Pray heavens he be,
For I have served him, and the man commands
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
As well to see the vessel that's come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard.
THIRD GENTLEMAN:
Come, let's do so,
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance.
CASSIO:
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
Give him defense against the elements,
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
MONTANO:
I she well shipp'd?
CASSIO:
His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
Stand in bold cure.
FOURTH GENTLEMAN:
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
Stand ranks of people, and they cry, "A sail!"
CASSIO:
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
They do discharge their shot of courtesy-
Our friends at least.
CASSIO:
I pray you, sir, go forth,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
I shall.
MONTANO:
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
CASSIO:
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame,
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
CASSIO:
He has had most favorable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
The gutter'd rocks, and congregated sands,
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona.
MONTANO:
What is she?
CASSIO:
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
And bring all Cyprus comfort.
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hall to thee, lady! And the grace of heaven,
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
Enwheel thee round!
DESDEMONA:
I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
CASSIO:
He is not yet arrived, nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.
DESDEMONA:
O, but I fear- How lost you company?
CASSIO:
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship- But, hark! a sail.
SECOND GENTLEMAN:
They give their greeting to the citadel;
This likewise is a friend.
CASSIO:
See for the news.
Good ancient, you are welcome. Welcome, mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
IAGO:
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You'ld have enough.
DESDEMONA:
Alas, she has no speech.
IAGO:
In faith, too much;
I find it still when I have list to sleep.
Marry, before your ladyship I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart
And chides with thinking.
EMILIA:
You have little cause to say so.
IAGO:
Come on, come on. You are pictures out of doors,
Bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,
Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,
Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.
DESDEMONA:
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
IAGO:
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
You rise to play, and go to bed to work.
EMILIA:
You shall not write my praise.
IAGO:
No, let me not.
DESDEMONA:
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
praise me?
IAGO:
O gentle lady, do not put me to't,
For I am nothing if not critical.
DESDEMONA:
Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
IAGO:
Ay, madam.
DESDEMONA:
I am not merry, but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
IAGO:
I am about it, but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze;
It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors,
And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
The one's for use, the other useth it.
DESDEMONA:
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
IAGO:
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
DESDEMONA:
Worse and worse.
EMILIA:
How if fair and foolish?
IAGO:
She never yet was foolish that was fair,
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
DESDEMONA:
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the
alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and
foolish?
IAGO:
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
DESDEMONA:
O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what
praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that
in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very
malice itself?
IAGO:
She that was ever fair and never proud,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
Fled from her wish and yet said, "Now I may";
She that, being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
See suitors following and not look behind;
She was a wight, if ever such wight were-
DESDEMONA:
To do what?
IAGO:
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
DESDEMONA:
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him,
Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not
a most profane and liberal counselor?
CASSIO:
He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the
soldier than in the scholar.
IAGO:
[Aside.] He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper.
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as
Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own
courtship. You say true; 'tis so, indeed. If such tricks as these
strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had
not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are
most apt to play the sir in. Very good. Well kissed! an excellent
courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips?
Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
The Moor! I know his trumpet.
CASSIO:
'Tis truly so.
DESDEMONA:
Let's meet him and receive him.
CASSIO:
Lo, where he comes!
OTHELLO:
O my fair warrior!
DESDEMONA:
My dear Othello!
OTHELLO:
It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high, and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.
DESDEMONA:
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!
OTHELLO:
Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content;
It stops me here; it is too much of joy.
And this, and this, the greatest discords be
That e'er our hearts shall make!
IAGO:
[Aside.] O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
As honest as I am.
OTHELLO:
Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends: our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Once more well met at Cyprus.
IAGO:
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor. Come hither. If thou
be'st valiant- as they say base men being in love have then a
nobility in their natures more than is native to them- list me.
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I
must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
RODERIGO:
With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
IAGO:
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me
with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and
telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for
prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be
fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be,
again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite,
loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties-
all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor;
very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and
unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this
fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present
itself- a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds
look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found
him already.
RODERIGO:
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest
condition.
IAGO:
Blest fig's-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If
she had been blest, she would never have loved the Moor. Blest
pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?
Didst not mark that?
RODERIGO:
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
IAGO:
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the
history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their
lips that their breaths embraced together. Villainous thoughts,
Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand
comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion.
Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you from
Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I'll lay't upon you.
Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you. Do you find some
occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please,
which the time shall more favorably minister.
RODERIGO:
Well.
IAGO:
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may
strike at you. Provoke him, that he may; for even out of that
will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall
come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means
I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most
profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation
of our prosperity.
RODERIGO:
I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
IAGO:
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must
fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
RODERIGO:
Adieu.
IAGO:
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife.
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.
HERALD:
It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general,
that upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere
perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into
triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what
sport and revels his addiction leads him; for besides these
beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much
was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and
there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus
and our noble general Othello!
OTHELLO:
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop,
Not to outsport discretion.
CASSIO:
Iago hath direction what to do;
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
Will I look to't.
OTHELLO:
Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you. Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
CASSIO:
Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
IAGO:
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our
general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let
us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night
with her, and she is sport for Jove.
CASSIO:
She's a most exquisite lady.
IAGO:
And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
CASSIO:
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
IAGO:
What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to
provocation.
CASSIO:
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
IAGO:
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
CASSIO:
She is indeed perfection.
IAGO:
Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a
stope of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants
that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.
CASSIO:
Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains
for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other
custom of entertainment.
IAGO:
O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
CASSIO:
I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily
qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am
unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with
any more.
IAGO:
What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
CASSIO:
Where are they?
IAGO:
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
CASSIO:
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.
IAGO:
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
With that which he hath drunk tonight already,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offense
As my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
That hold their honors in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle. But here they come.
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
CASSIO:
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
MONTANO:
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a
soldier.
IAGO:
Some wine, ho!
Some wine, boys!
CASSIO:
'Fore God, an excellent song.
IAGO:
I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in
potting. Your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander-
Drink, ho!- are nothing to your English.
CASSIO:
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
IAGO:
Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he
sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a
vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
CASSIO:
To the health of our general!
MONTANO:
I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
IAGO:
O sweet England!
Some wine, ho!
CASSIO:
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
IAGO:
Will you hear't again?
CASSIO:
No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
those things. Well, God's above all, and there be souls must be
saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
IAGO:
It's true, good lieutenant.
CASSIO:
For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man
of quality- I hope to be saved.
IAGO:
And so do I too, lieutenant.
CASSIO:
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to
be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to
our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to
our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my
ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not
drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
ALL:
Excellent well.
CASSIO:
Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am
drunk.
MONTANO:
To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
IAGO:
You see this fellow that is gone before;
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction. And do but see his vice;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as the other. 'Tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in
On some odd time of his infirmity
Will shake this island.
MONTANO:
But is he often thus?
IAGO:
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.
He'll watch the horologe a double set,
If drink rock not his cradle.
MONTANO:
It were well
The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
IAGO:
[Aside to him.] How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
MONTANO:
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity.
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor.
IAGO:
Not I, for this fair island.
I do love Cassio well, and would do much
To cure him of this evil- But, hark! What noise?
CASSIO:
'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
MONTANO:
What's the matter, lieutenant?
CASSIO:
A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a
twiggen bottle.
RODERIGO:
Beat me!
CASSIO:
Dost thou prate, rogue?
MONTANO:
Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
CASSIO:
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
MONTANO:
Come, come, you're drunk.
CASSIO:
Drunk?
IAGO:
[Aside to Roderigo.] Away, I say; go out and cry a mutiny.
Nay, good lieutenant! God's will, gentlemen!
Help, ho!- Lieutenant- sir- Montano- sir-
Help, masters!- Here's a goodly watch indeed!
Who's that that rings the bell?- Diablo, ho!
The town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!
You will be shamed forever.
OTHELLO:
What is the matter here?
MONTANO:
'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
OTHELLO:
Hold, for your lives!
IAGO:
Hold, ho! Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen-
Have you forgot all place of sense and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you! Hold, hold, for shame!
OTHELLO:
Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl.
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell; it frights the isle
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
Speak: who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.
IAGO:
I do not know. Friends all but now, even now,
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
OTHELLO:
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
CASSIO:
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
OTHELLO:
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted, and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter,
That you unlace your reputation thus,
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.
MONTANO:
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.
Your officer, Iago, can inform you-
While I spare speech, which something now offends me-
Of all that I do know. Nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night,
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.
OTHELLO:
Now, by heaven,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule,
And passion, having my best judgement collied,
Assays to lead the way. If I once stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on,
And he that is approved in this offense,
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
MONTANO:
If partially affined, or leagued in office,
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
Thou art no soldier.
IAGO:
Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help,
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamor- as it so fell out-
The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
I ne'er might say before. When I came back-
For this was brief- I found them close together,
At blow and thrust, even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report.
But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity,
Which patience could not pass.
OTHELLO:
I know, Iago,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,
But never more be officer of mine.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.
DESDEMONA:
What's the matter?
OTHELLO:
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.
Lead him off.
Iago, look with care about the town,
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona, 'tis the soldiers' life.
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
IAGO:
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
CASSIO:
Ay, past all surgery.
IAGO:
Marry, heaven forbid!
CASSIO:
Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my
reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what
remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
IAGO:
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily
wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation
is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and
lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are
ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his
mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one
would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue
to him again, and he's yours.
CASSIO:
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an
officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear?
and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call
thee devil!
IAGO:
What was he that you followed with your sword?
What had he done to you?
CASSIO:
I know not.
IAGO:
Is't possible?
CASSIO:
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a
quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an
enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should,
with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves
into beasts!
IAGO:
Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus
CASSIO:
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me
frankly despise myself.
IAGO:
Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,
and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish
this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your
own good.
CASSIO:
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a
drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would
stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and
presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblest,
and the ingredient is a devil.
IAGO:
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be
well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I
think you think I love you.
CASSIO:
I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
IAGO:
You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll
tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the
general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted
and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement
of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her;
importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so
free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a
vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This
broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter;
and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your
love shall grow stronger than it was before.
CASSIO:
You advise me well.
IAGO:
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
CASSIO:
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech
the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my
fortunes if they check me here.
IAGO:
You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the
watch.
CASSIO:
Good night, honest Iago.
IAGO:
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor, were't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now. For whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.
RODERIGO:
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I
have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled; and I think the
issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and
so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to
Venice.
IAGO:
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted.
Away, I say. Thou shalt know more hereafter.
Nay, get thee gone. Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress-
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way;
Dull not device by coldness and delay.
CASSIO:
Masters, play here, I will content your pains; Something
that's brief; and bid "Good morrow, general."
Music.
CLOWN:
Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that
they speak i' the nose thus?
FIRST MUSICIAN:
How, sir, how?
CLOWN:
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
FIRST MUSICIAN:
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
CLOWN:
O, thereby hangs a tail.
FIRST MUSICIAN:
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
CLOWN:
Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But,
masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your
music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more
noise with it.
FIRST MUSICIAN:
Well, sir, we will not.
CLOWN:
If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again;
but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly
care.
FIRST MUSICIAN:
We have none such, sir.
CLOWN:
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away.
Go, vanish into air, away!
CASSIO:
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
CLOWN:
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
CASSIO:
Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold
for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be
stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor
of speech. Wilt thou do this?
CLOWN:
She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem
to notify unto her.
CASSIO:
Do, good my friend.
IAGO:
You have not been abed, then?
CASSIO:
Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife. My suit to her
Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.
IAGO:
I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.
CASSIO:
I humbly thank you for't. I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.
EMILIA:
Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry
For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it,
And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.
CASSIO:
Yet, I beseech you,
If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.
EMILIA:
Pray you, come in.
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.
CASSIO:
I am much bound to you.
OTHELLO:
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
And by him do my duties to the Senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.
IAGO:
Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
OTHELLO:
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
GENTLEMEN:
We'll wait upon your lordship.
DESDEMONA:
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.
EMILIA:
Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the cause were his.
DESDEMONA:
O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.
CASSIO:
Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never anything but your true servant.
DESDEMONA:
I know't: I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a politic distance.
CASSIO:
Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstances,
That I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.
DESDEMONA:
Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place, assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article. My lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle everything he does
With Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.
EMILIA:
Madam, here comes my lord.
CASSIO:
Madam, I'll take my leave.
DESDEMONA:
Nay, stay and hear me speak.
CASSIO:
Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,
Unfit for mine own purposes.
DESDEMONA:
Well, do your discretion.
IAGO:
Ha! I like not that.
OTHELLO:
What dost thou say?
IAGO:
Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.
OTHELLO:
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
IAGO:
Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.
OTHELLO:
I do believe 'twas he.
DESDEMONA:
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
OTHELLO:
Who is't you mean?
DESDEMONA:
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgement in an honest face.
I prithee, call him back.
OTHELLO:
Went he hence now?
DESDEMONA:
Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
OTHELLO:
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
DESDEMONA:
But shall't be shortly?
OTHELLO:
The sooner, sweet, for you.
DESDEMONA:
Shall't be tonight at supper?
OTHELLO:
No, not tonight.
DESDEMONA:
Tomorrow dinner then?
OTHELLO:
I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.
DESDEMONA:
Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,
On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn.
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days. In faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason-
Save that, they say, the wars must make example
Out of their best- is not almost a fault
To incur a private check. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,
That came awooing with you, and so many a time
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much-
OTHELLO:
Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.
DESDEMONA:
Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
And fearful to be granted.
OTHELLO:
I will deny thee nothing,
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.
DESDEMONA:
Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
OTHELLO:
Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
DESDEMONA:
Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
OTHELLO:
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.
IAGO:
My noble lord-
OTHELLO:
What dost thou say, Iago?
IAGO:
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?
OTHELLO:
He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
IAGO:
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.
OTHELLO:
Why of thy thought, Iago?
IAGO:
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
OTHELLO:
O, yes, and went between us very oft.
IAGO:
Indeed!
OTHELLO:
Indeed? ay, indeed. Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
IAGO:
Honest, my lord?
OTHELLO:
Honest? Ay, honest.
IAGO:
My lord, for aught I know.
OTHELLO:
What dost thou think?
IAGO:
Think, my lord?
OTHELLO:
Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.
I heard thee say even now, thou like'st not that,
When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, "Indeed!"
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.
IAGO:
My lord, you know I love you.
OTHELLO:
I think thou dost;
And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just
They're close dilations, working from the heart,
That passion cannot rule.
IAGO:
For Michael Cassio,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
OTHELLO:
I think so too.
IAGO:
Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
OTHELLO:
Certain, men should be what they seem.
IAGO:
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
OTHELLO:
Nay, yet there's more in this.
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.
IAGO:
Good my lord, pardon me;
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit
With meditations lawful?
OTHELLO:
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.
IAGO:
I do beseech you-
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.
OTHELLO:
What dost thou mean?
IAGO:
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
OTHELLO:
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
IAGO:
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
OTHELLO:
Ha!
IAGO:
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
OTHELLO:
O misery!
IAGO:
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!
OTHELLO:
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes and chose me. No, Iago,
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this-
Away at once with love or jealousy!
IAGO:
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.
I would not have your free and noble nature
Out of self-bounty be abused. Look to't.
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
OTHELLO:
Dost thou say so?
IAGO:
She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.
OTHELLO:
And so she did.
IAGO:
Why, go to then.
She that so young could give out such a seeming,
To seel her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.
OTHELLO:
I am bound to thee forever.
IAGO:
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
OTHELLO:
Not a jot, not a jot.
IAGO:
I'faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved;
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.
OTHELLO:
I will not.
IAGO:
Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
Which my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-
My lord, I see you're moved.
OTHELLO:
No, not much moved.
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
IAGO:
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
OTHELLO:
And yet, how nature erring from itself-
IAGO:
Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you-
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends-
Foh, one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me. I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear,
Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,
May fall to match you with her country forms,
And happily repent.
OTHELLO:
Farewell, farewell.
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.
IAGO:
[Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
OTHELLO:
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
IAGO:
[Returning.] My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time.
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
For sure he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means.
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears-
As worthy cause I have to fear I am-
And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
OTHELLO:
Fear not my government.
IAGO:
I once more take my leave.
OTHELLO:
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years- yet that's not much-
She's gone. I am abused, and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.
DESDEMONA:
How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.
OTHELLO:
I am to blame.
DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?
OTHELLO:
I have a pain upon my forehead here.
DESDEMONA:
Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again.
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.
OTHELLO:
Your napkin is too little;
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
DESDEMONA:
I am very sorry that you are not well.
EMILIA:
I am glad I have found this napkin;
This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago. What he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.
IAGO:
How now, what do you here alone?
EMILIA:
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
IAGO:
A thing for me? It is a common thing-
EMILIA:
Ha!
IAGO:
To have a foolish wife.
EMILIA:
O, is that all? What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief?
IAGO:
What handkerchief?
EMILIA:
What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
That which so often you did bid me steal.
IAGO:
Hast stol'n it from her?
EMILIA:
No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.
Look, here it is.
IAGO:
A good wench; give it me.
EMILIA:
What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it?
IAGO:
[Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
EMILIA:
If't be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again. Poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.
IAGO:
Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
And let him find it. Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
But with a little act upon the blood
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so.
Look, where he comes!
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday.
OTHELLO:
Ha, ha, false to me?
IAGO:
Why, how now, general! No more of that.
OTHELLO:
Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.
IAGO:
How now, my lord?
OTHELLO:
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me;
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all.
IAGO:
I am sorry to hear this.
OTHELLO:
I had been happy if the general camp,
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
So I had nothing known. O, now forever
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell,
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
IAGO:
Is't possible, my lord?
OTHELLO:
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof;
Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!
IAGO:
Is't come to this?
OTHELLO:
Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
IAGO:
My noble lord-
OTHELLO:
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.
IAGO:
O grace! O heaven defend me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool,
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit, and from hence
I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense.
OTHELLO:
Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
IAGO:
I should be wise; for honesty's a fool,
And loses that it works for.
OTHELLO:
By the world,
I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;
I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,
Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
IAGO:
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
OTHELLO:
Would? Nay, I will.
IAGO:
And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?
Behold her topp'd?
OTHELLO:
Death and damnation! O!
IAGO:
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
OTHELLO:
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
IAGO:
I do not like the office;
But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
One of this kind is Cassio.
In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves";
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry, "O sweet creature!" and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots,
That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd and kiss'd; and then
Cried, "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"
OTHELLO:
O monstrous! monstrous!
IAGO:
Nay, this was but his dream.
OTHELLO:
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
IAGO:
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.
OTHELLO:
I'll tear her all to pieces.
IAGO:
Nay, but be wise; yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this;
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
OTHELLO:
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
IAGO:
I know not that; but such a handkerchief-
I am sure it was your wife's- did I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with.
OTHELLO:
If it be that-
IAGO:
If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.
OTHELLO:
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago,
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
IAGO:
Yet be content.
OTHELLO:
O, blood, blood, blood!
IAGO:
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
OTHELLO:
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.
IAGO:
Do not rise yet.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.
OTHELLO:
I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.
IAGO:
My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request;
But let her live.
OTHELLO:
Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
IAGO:
I am your own forever.
DESDEMONA:
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
CLOWN:
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
DESDEMONA:
Why, man?
CLOWN:
He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is
stabbing.
DESDEMONA:
Go to! Where lodges he?
CLOWN:
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
DESDEMONA:
Can anything be made of this?
CLOWN:
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging,
and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own
throat.
DESDEMONA:
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
CLOWN:
I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions
and by them answer.
DESDEMONA:
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my
lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
CLOWN:
To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore
I will attempt the doing it.
DESDEMONA:
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
EMILIA:
I know not, madam.
DESDEMONA:
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes; and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.
EMILIA:
Is he not jealous?
DESDEMONA:
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humors from him.
EMILIA:
Look, where he comes.
DESDEMONA:
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
OTHELLO:
Well, my good lady. O, hardness to dissemble!
How do you, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA:
Well, my good lord.
OTHELLO:
Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
DESDEMONA:
It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
OTHELLO:
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout,
For here's a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.
DESDEMONA:
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
OTHELLO:
A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
DESDEMONA:
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
OTHELLO:
What promise, chuck?
DESDEMONA:
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
OTHELLO:
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.
DESDEMONA:
Here, my lord.
OTHELLO:
That which I gave you.
DESDEMONA:
I have it not about me.
OTHELLO:
Not?
DESDEMONA:
No, faith, my lord.
OTHELLO:
That's a fault. That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies. She dying gave it me,
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so, and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.
DESDEMONA:
Is't possible?
OTHELLO:
'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
Conserved of maiden's hearts.
DESDEMONA:
Indeed! is't true?
OTHELLO:
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
DESDEMONA:
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
OTHELLO:
Ha! wherefore?
DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
OTHELLO:
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
DESDEMONA:
Heaven bless us!
OTHELLO:
Say you?
DESDEMONA:
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
OTHELLO:
How?
DESDEMONA:
I say, it is not lost.
OTHELLO:
Fetch't, let me see it.
DESDEMONA:
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
OTHELLO:
Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
DESDEMONA:
Come, come,
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA:
I pray, talk me of Cassio.
OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA:
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you-
OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
DESDEMONA:
In sooth, you are to blame.
OTHELLO:
Away!
EMILIA:
Is not this man jealous?
DESDEMONA:
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief;
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
EMILIA:
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
They belch us. Look you! Cassio and my husband.
IAGO:
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't.
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
DESDEMONA:
How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
CASSIO:
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honor. I would not be delay'd.
If my offense be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Nor purposed merit in futurity
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content
And shut myself up in some other course
To Fortune's alms.
DESDEMONA:
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him
Were he in favor as in humor alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.
IAGO:
Is my lord angry?
EMILIA:
He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.
IAGO:
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother. And can he be angry?
Something of moment then. I will go meet him.
There's matter in't indeed if he be angry.
DESDEMONA:
I prithee, do so.
Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observancy
As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.
EMILIA:
Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.
DESDEMONA:
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
EMILIA:
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous. 'Tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
DESDEMONA:
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
EMILIA:
Lady, amen.
DESDEMONA:
I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout.
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit,
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
CASSIO:
I humbly thank your ladyship.
BIANCA:
Save you, friend Cassio!
CASSIO:
What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I'faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
BIANCA:
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!
CASSIO:
Pardon me, Bianca.
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd;
But I shall in a more continuate time
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
Take me this work out.
BIANCA:
O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend.
To the felt absence now I feel a cause.
Is't come to this? Well, well.
CASSIO:
Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance.
No, by my faith, Bianca.
BIANCA:
Why, whose is it?
CASSIO:
I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well. Ere it be demanded-
As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied.
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
BIANCA:
Leave you! wherefore?
CASSIO:
I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.
BIANCA:
Why, I pray you?
CASSIO:
Not that I love you not.
BIANCA:
But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.
CASSIO:
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
For I attend here, but I'll see you soon.
BIANCA:
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
IAGO:
Will you think so?
OTHELLO:
Think so, Iago?
IAGO:
What,
To kiss in private?
OTHELLO:
An unauthorized kiss.
IAGO:
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
OTHELLO:
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven.
IAGO:
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief-
OTHELLO:
What then?
IAGO:
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
OTHELLO:
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
IAGO:
Her honor is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not.
But for the handkerchief-
OTHELLO:
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st- O, it comes o'er my memory,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
Boding to all- he had my handkerchief.
IAGO:
Ay, what of that?
OTHELLO:
That's not so good now.
IAGO:
What,
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad,
Who having, by their own importunate suit,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
But they must blab-
OTHELLO:
Hath he said anything?
IAGO:
He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
No more than he'll unswear.
OTHELLO:
What hath he said?
IAGO:
Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
OTHELLO:
What? what?
IAGO:
Lie-
OTHELLO:
With her?
IAGO:
With her, on her, what you will.
OTHELLO:
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they
belie her. Lie with her! 'Zounds, that's fulsome! Handkerchief-
confessions- handkerchief! To confess and be hanged for his labor-
first, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without
some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish!
Noses, ears, and lips. Is't possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O
devil!
IAGO:
Work on,
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!
CASSIO:
What's the matter?
IAGO:
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
CASSIO:
Rub him about the temples.
IAGO:
No, forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course.
If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
He will recover straight. When he is gone,
I would on great occasion speak with you.
How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?
OTHELLO:
Dost thou mock me?
IAGO:
I mock you? No, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
OTHELLO:
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
IAGO:
There's many a beast then in a populous city,
And many a civil monster.
OTHELLO:
Did he confess it?
IAGO:
Good sir, be a man;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you. There's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
OTHELLO:
O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
IAGO:
Stand you awhile apart,
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife.
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.
OTHELLO:
Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But (dost thou hear?) most bloody.
IAGO:
That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature
That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behavior
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
CASSIO:
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.
IAGO:
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
How quickly should you speed!
CASSIO:
Alas, poor caitiff!
OTHELLO:
Look, how he laughs already!
IAGO:
I never knew a woman love man so.
CASSIO:
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
OTHELLO:
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
IAGO:
Do you hear, Cassio?
OTHELLO:
Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er. Go to; well said, well said.
IAGO:
She gives it out that you shall marry her.
Do you intend it?
CASSIO:
Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO:
Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
CASSIO:
I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity
to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO:
So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
IAGO:
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
CASSIO:
Prithee, say true.
IAGO:
I am a very villain else.
OTHELLO:
Have you scored me? Well.
CASSIO:
This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I
will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my
promise.
OTHELLO:
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
CASSIO:
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was
the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and
thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus
about my neck-
OTHELLO:
Crying, "O dear Cassio!" as it were; his gesture imports
it.
CASSIO:
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls
me. Ha, ha, ha!
OTHELLO:
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see
that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
CASSIO:
Well, I must leave her company.
IAGO:
Before me! look where she comes.
CASSIO:
'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfumed one.
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
BIANCA:
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by
that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to
take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it
there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?
There, give it your hobbyhorse. Wheresoever you had it, I'll take
out no work on't.
CASSIO:
How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
OTHELLO:
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
BIANCA:
An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not,
come when you are next prepared for.
IAGO:
After her, after her.
CASSIO:
Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
IAGO:
Will you sup there?
CASSIO:
Faith, I intend so.
IAGO:
Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak
with you.
CASSIO:
Prithee, come; will you?
IAGO:
Go to; say no more.
OTHELLO:
[Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
IAGO:
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
OTHELLO:
O Iago!
IAGO:
And did you see the handkerchief?
OTHELLO:
Was that mine?
IAGO:
Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish
woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
OTHELLO:
I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair
woman! a sweet woman!
IAGO:
Nay, you must forget that.
OTHELLO:
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for
she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it,
and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature.
She might lie by an emperor's side, and command him tasks.
IAGO:
Nay, that's not your way.
OTHELLO:
Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her
needle, an admirable musician. O, she will sing the savageness
out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention-
IAGO:
She's the worse for all this.
OTHELLO:
O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a
condition!
IAGO:
Ay, too gentle.
OTHELLO:
Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
IAGO:
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to
offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
OTHELLO:
I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
IAGO:
O, 'tis foul in her.
OTHELLO:
With mine officer!
IAGO:
That's fouler.
OTHELLO:
Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate
with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This
night, Iago.
IAGO:
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed
she hath contaminated.
OTHELLO:
Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
IAGO:
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more
by midnight.
OTHELLO:
Excellent good. What trumpet is that
same?
IAGO:
Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
Come from the Duke. And, see your wife is with him.
LODOVICO:
God save the worthy general!
OTHELLO:
With all my heart, sir.
LODOVICO:
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you.
OTHELLO:
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
DESDEMONA:
And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
IAGO:
I am very glad to see you, signior;
Welcome to Cyprus.
LODOVICO:
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
IAGO:
Lives, sir.
DESDEMONA:
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breech; but you shall make all well.
OTHELLO:
Are you sure of that?
DESDEMONA:
My lord?
OTHELLO:
[Reads.] "This fail you not to do, as you will-"
LODOVICO:
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
DESDEMONA:
A most unhappy one. I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
OTHELLO:
Fire and brimstone!
DESDEMONA:
My lord?
OTHELLO:
Are you wise?
DESDEMONA:
What, is he angry?
LODOVICO:
May be the letter moved him;
For, as I think, they do command him home,
Deputing Cassio in his government.
DESDEMONA:
By my troth, I am glad on't.
OTHELLO:
Indeed!
DESDEMONA:
My lord?
OTHELLO:
I am glad to see you mad.
DESDEMONA:
Why, sweet Othello?
OTHELLO:
Devil!
DESDEMONA:
I have not deserved this.
LODOVICO:
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
Though I should swear I saw't. 'Tis very much.
Make her amends; she weeps.
OTHELLO:
O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!
DESDEMONA:
[Going.] I will not stay to offend you.
LODOVICO:
Truly, an obedient lady.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
OTHELLO:
Mistress!
DESDEMONA:
My lord?
OTHELLO:
What would you with her, sir?
LODOVICO:
Who, I, my lord?
OTHELLO:
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Sir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on,
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir- O well-painted passion!-
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
I do entreat that we may sup together.
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!
LODOVICO:
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
Call all in all sufficient? This the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce?
IAGO:
He is much changed.
LODOVICO:
Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
IAGO:
He's that he is. I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not,
I would to heaven he were!
LODOVICO:
What, strike his wife!
IAGO:
Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst!
LODOVICO:
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood,
And new create this fault?
IAGO:
Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech. Do but go after,
And mark how he continues.
LODOVICO:
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
OTHELLO:
You have seen nothing, then?
EMILIA:
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
OTHELLO:
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
EMILIA:
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.
OTHELLO:
What, did they never whisper?
EMILIA:
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO:
Nor send you out o' the way?
EMILIA:
Never.
OTHELLO:
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
EMILIA:
Never, my lord.
OTHELLO:
That's strange.
EMILIA:
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.
OTHELLO:
Bid her come hither; go.
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
DESDEMONA:
My lord, what is your will?
OTHELLO:
Pray, chuck, come hither.
DESDEMONA:
What is your pleasure?
OTHELLO:
Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.
DESDEMONA:
What horrible fancy's this?
OTHELLO:
[To Emilia.] Some of your function, mistress,
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough, or cry "hem," if anybody come.
Your mystery, your mystery; nay, dispatch.
DESDEMONA:
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,
But not the words.
OTHELLO:
Why, what art thou?
DESDEMONA:
Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
OTHELLO:
Come, swear it, damn thyself;
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn'd;
Swear thou art honest.
DESDEMONA:
Heaven doth truly know it.
OTHELLO:
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
DESDEMONA:
To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
OTHELLO:
O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
DESDEMONA:
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.
OTHELLO:
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction, had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well;
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,
Ay, there, look grim as hell!
DESDEMONA:
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
OTHELLO:
O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!
DESDEMONA:
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
OTHELLO:
Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write "whore" upon? What committed?
Committed? O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;
The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
And will not hear it. What committed?
Impudent strumpet!
DESDEMONA:
By heaven, you do me wrong.
OTHELLO:
Are not you a strumpet?
DESDEMONA:
No, as I am a Christian.
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
OTHELLO:
What, not a whore?
DESDEMONA:
No, as I shall be saved.
OTHELLO:
Is't possible?
DESDEMONA:
O, heaven forgive us!
OTHELLO:
I cry you mercy then;
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello. You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains.
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel.
EMILIA:
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?
DESDEMONA:
Faith, half asleep.
EMILIA:
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
DESDEMONA:
With who?
EMILIA:
Why, with my lord, madam.
DESDEMONA:
Who is thy lord?
EMILIA:
He that is yours, sweet lady.
DESDEMONA:
I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep, nor answer have I none
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember,
And call thy husband hither.
EMILIA:
Here's a change indeed!
DESDEMONA:
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
IAGO:
What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
DESDEMONA:
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.
He might have chid me so, for in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.
IAGO:
What's the matter, lady?
EMILIA:
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.
DESDEMONA:
Am I that name, Iago?
IAGO:
What name, fair lady?
DESDEMONA:
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
EMILIA:
He call'd her whore; a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.
IAGO:
Why did he so?
DESDEMONA:
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
IAGO:
Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
EMILIA:
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? Would it not make one weep?
DESDEMONA:
It is my wretched fortune.
IAGO:
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?
DESDEMONA:
Nay, heaven doth know.
EMILIA:
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
IAGO:
Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
DESDEMONA:
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
EMILIA:
A halter pardon him! And hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?
What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!
IAGO:
Speak within door.
EMILIA:
O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
IAGO:
You are a fool; go to.
DESDEMONA:
O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him, for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form,
Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
And ever will, though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement, love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say "whore."
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
IAGO:
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humor:
The business of the state does him offense,
And he does chide with you.
DESDEMONA:
If 'twere no other-
IAGO:
'Tis but so, I warrant.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
How now, Roderigo!
RODERIGO:
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
IAGO:
What in the contrary?
RODERIGO:
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and
rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed
no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace
what already I have foolishly suffered.
IAGO:
Will you hear me, Roderigo?
RODERIGO:
Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
performances are no kin together.
IAGO:
You charge me most unjustly.
RODERIGO:
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my
means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona
would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath
received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance; but I find none.
IAGO:
Well, go to, very well.
RODERIGO:
Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very
well. By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find
myself fopped in it.
IAGO:
Very well.
RODERIGO:
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known
to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over
my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure
yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
IAGO:
You have said now.
RODERIGO:
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
doing.
IAGO:
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this
instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give
me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just
exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy
affair.
RODERIGO:
It hath not appeared.
IAGO:
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is
not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that
in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than
ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from
this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
RODERIGO:
Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
IAGO:
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
Cassio in Othello's place.
RODERIGO:
Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
to Venice.
IAGO:
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the
fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some
accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
Cassio.
RODERIGO:
How do you mean, removing of him?
IAGO:
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out
his brains.
RODERIGO:
And that you would have me to do?
IAGO:
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups
tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows
not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going
thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and
one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second
your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not
amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a
necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to
waste. About it.
RODERIGO:
I will hear further reason for this.
IAGO:
And you shall be satisfied.
LODOVICO:
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
OTHELLO:
O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
LODOVICO:
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
DESDEMONA:
Your honor is most welcome.
OTHELLO:
Will you walk, sir?
O- Desdemona-
DESDEMONA:
My lord?
OTHELLO:
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there; look it be done.
DESDEMONA:
I will, my lord.
EMILIA:
How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
DESDEMONA:
He says he will return incontinent.
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.
EMILIA:
Dismiss me?
DESDEMONA:
It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
We must not now displease him.
EMILIA:
I would you had never seen him!
DESDEMONA:
So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns-
Prithee, unpin me- have grace and favor in them.
EMILIA:
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
DESDEMONA:
All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me
In one of those same sheets.
EMILIA:
Come, come, you talk.
DESDEMONA:
My mother had a maid call'd Barbary;
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her. She had a song of "willow";
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it. That song tonight
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.
EMILIA:
Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
DESDEMONA:
No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.
EMILIA:
A very handsome man.
DESDEMONA:
He speaks well.
EMILIA:
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
DESDEMONA:
[Sings.]
Lay be these-
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon-
Nay, that's not next. Hark, who is't that knocks?
EMILIA:
It's the wind.
DESDEMONA:
[Sings.]
So get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?
EMILIA:
'Tis neither here nor there.
DESDEMONA:
I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think- tell me, Emilia-
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?
EMILIA:
There be some such, no question.
DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA:
Why, would not you?
DESDEMONA:
No, by this heavenly light!
EMILIA:
Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well
i' the dark.
DESDEMONA:
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
EMILIA:
The world's a huge thing; it is a great price
For a small vice.
DESDEMONA:
In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
EMILIA:
In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had done.
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for
measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any
petty exhibition; but, for the whole world- why, who would not
make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should
venture purgatory for't.
DESDEMONA:
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.
EMILIA:
Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the
world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you
might quickly make it right.
DESDEMONA:
I do not think there is any such woman.
EMILIA:
Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage as would store the
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall; say that they slack their duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us, or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite,
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them; they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too. And have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well; else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
DESDEMONA:
Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
IAGO:
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow.
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.
RODERIGO:
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
IAGO:
Here, at thy hand, be bold, and take thy stand.
RETIRES:
RODERIGO:
I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
IAGO:
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die. Be't so. I hear him coming.
RODERIGO:
I know his gait; 'tis he. Villain, thou diest!
CASSIO:
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st;
I will make proof of thine.
RODERIGO:
O, I am slain!
CASSIO:
I am maim'd forever. Help, ho! Murther! Murther!
Falls.
OTHELLO:
The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
RODERIGO:
O, villain that I am!
OTHELLO:
It is even so.
CASSIO:
O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
OTHELLO:
'Tis he. O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted.
CASSIO:
What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
GRATIANO:
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
CASSIO:
O, help!
LODOVICO:
Hark!
RODERIGO:
O wretched villain!
LODOVICO:
Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe
To come in to the cry without more help.
RODERIGO:
Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
LODOVICO:
Hark!
GRATIANO:
Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
IAGO:
Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
LODOVICO:
We do not know.
IAGO:
Did not you hear a cry?
CASSIO:
Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
IAGO:
What's the matter?
GRATIANO:
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
LODOVICO:
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
IAGO:
What are you here that cry so grievously?
CASSIO:
Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.
IAGO:
O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
CASSIO:
I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.
IAGO:
O treacherous villains!
Come in and give some help.
RODERIGO:
O, help me here!
CASSIO:
That's one of them.
IAGO:
O murtherous slave! O villain!
RODERIGO:
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
IAGO:
Kill men i' the dark! Where be these bloody thieves?
How silent is this town! Ho! Murther! Murther!
What may you be? Are you of good or evil?
LODOVICO:
As you shall prove us, praise us.
IAGO:
Signior Lodovico?
LODOVICO:
He, sir.
IAGO:
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
GRATIANO:
Cassio?
IAGO:
How is't, brother?
CASSIO:
My leg is cut in two.
IAGO:
Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
BIANCA:
What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
IAGO:
Who is't that cried?
BIANCA:
O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio,
IAGO:
O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
Who they should be that have thus mangled you?
CASSIO:
No.
GRATIANO:
I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
IAGO:
Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
To bear him easily hence!
BIANCA:
Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
IAGO:
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo? No- yes, sure. O heaven! Roderigo.
GRATIANO:
What, of Venice?
IAGO:
Even he, sir. Did you know him?
GRATIANO:
Know him! ay.
IAGO:
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
That so neglected you.
GRATIANO:
I am glad to see you.
IAGO:
How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
GRATIANO:
Roderigo!
IAGO:
He, he, 'tis he. O, that's well said:
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. For you, mistress,
Save you your labor. He that lies slain here, Cassio,
Was my dear friend; what malice was between you?
CASSIO:
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
IAGO:
[To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air.
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her.
Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
Though tongues were out of use.
EMILIA:
'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
IAGO:
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo, and fellows that are 'scaped;
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
EMILIA:
Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
IAGO:
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight.
What, do you shake at that?
BIANCA:
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
IAGO:
O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
EMILIA:
Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
BIANCA:
I am no strumpet, but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.
EMILIA:
As I! foh! fie upon thee!
IAGO:
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
Will you go on? This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
OTHELLO:
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore,
Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
I cannot give it vital growth again,
It must needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree.
O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more;
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
And love thee after. One more, and this the last;
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly,
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
DESDEMONA:
Who's there? Othello?
OTHELLO:
Ay, Desdemona.
DESDEMONA:
Will you come to bed, my lord?
OTHELLO:
Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
DESDEMONA:
Ay, my lord.
OTHELLO:
If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.
DESDEMONA:
Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
OTHELLO:
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by.
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.
No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
DESDEMONA:
Talk you of killing?
OTHELLO:
Ay, I do.
DESDEMONA:
Then heaven have mercy on me!
OTHELLO:
Amen, with all my heart!
DESDEMONA:
If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
OTHELLO:
Hum!
DESDEMONA:
And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
OTHELLO:
Think on thy sins.
DESDEMONA:
They are loves I bear to you.
OTHELLO:
Ay, and for that thou diest.
DESDEMONA:
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.
OTHELLO:
Peace, and be still!
DESDEMONA:
I will so. What's the matter?
OTHELLO:
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio.
DESDEMONA:
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.
OTHELLO:
Sweet soul, take heed,
Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.
DESDEMONA:
Ay, but not yet to die.
OTHELLO:
Yes, presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
DESDEMONA:
Then Lord have mercy on me!
OTHELLO:
I say, amen.
DESDEMONA:
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love. I never gave him token.
OTHELLO:
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand.
O perjured woman! Thou dost stone my heart,
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
I saw the handkerchief.
DESDEMONA:
He found it then;
I never gave it him. Send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
OTHELLO:
He hath confess'd.
DESDEMONA:
What, my lord?
OTHELLO:
That he hath used thee.
DESDEMONA:
How? unlawfully?
OTHELLO:
Ay.
DESDEMONA:
He will not say so.
OTHELLO:
No, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
DESDEMONA:
O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?
OTHELLO:
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
Had stomach for them all.
DESDEMONA:
Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!
OTHELLO:
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?
DESDEMONA:
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
OTHELLO:
Down, strumpet!
DESDEMONA:
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
OTHELLO:
Nay, if you strive-
DESDEMONA:
But half an hour!
OTHELLO:
Being done, there is no pause.
DESDEMONA:
But while I say one prayer!
OTHELLO:
It is too late.
EMILIA:
[Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO:
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
So, so.
EMILIA:
[Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
OTHELLO:
Who's there?
EMILIA:
[Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
OTHELLO:
Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?
I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.
My wife! My wife! What wife? I have no wife.
O, insupportable! O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration.
EMILIA:
[Within.] I do beseech you
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
OTHELLO:
I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.
Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
EMILIA:
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
OTHELLO:
What, now?
EMILIA:
But now, my lord.
OTHELLO:
It is the very error of the moon;
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
And makes men mad.
EMILIA:
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.
OTHELLO:
Roderigo kill'd?
And Cassio kill'd?
EMILIA:
No, Cassio is not kill'd.
OTHELLO:
Not Cassio kill'd! Then murther's out of tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.
DESDEMONA:
O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
EMILIA:
Alas, what cry is that?
OTHELLO:
That? what?
EMILIA:
Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!
DESDEMONA:
A guiltless death I die.
EMILIA:
O, who hath done this deed?
DESDEMONA:
Nobody; I myself. Farewell;
Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!
OTHELLO:
Why, how should she be murther'd?
EMILIA:
Alas, who knows?
OTHELLO:
You heard her say herself, it was not I.
EMILIA:
She said so; I must needs report the truth.
OTHELLO:
She's like a liar gone to burning hell;
'Twas I that kill'd her.
EMILIA:
O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!
OTHELLO:
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
EMILIA:
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
OTHELLO:
She was false as water.
EMILIA:
Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!
OTHELLO:
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
EMILIA:
My husband?
OTHELLO:
Thy husband.
EMILIA:
That she was false to wedlock?
OTHELLO:
Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
I'ld not have sold her for it.
EMILIA:
My husband?
OTHELLO:
Ay, 'twas he that told me first.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds.
EMILIA:
My husband?
OTHELLO:
What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
EMILIA:
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!
OTHELLO:
He, woman;
I say thy husband. Dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
EMILIA:
If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart.
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
OTHELLO:
Ha!
EMILIA:
Do thy worst;
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.
OTHELLO:
Peace, you were best.
EMILIA:
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed-
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives. Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther!
MONTANO:
What is the matter? How now, general?
EMILIA:
O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,
That men must lay their murthers on your neck.
GRATIANO:
What is the matter?
EMILIA:
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false;
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.
IAGO:
I told him what I thought, and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true.
EMILIA:
But did you ever tell him she was false?
IAGO:
I did.
EMILIA:
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!
She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?
IAGO:
With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
EMILIA:
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed-
ALL:
O heavens forfend!
EMILIA:
And your reports have set the murther on.
OTHELLO:
Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
GRATIANO:
'Tis a strange truth.
MONTANO:
O monstrous act!
EMILIA:
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
I think upon't, I think, I smell't, O villainy!
I thought so then. I'll kill myself for grief.
O villainy, villainy!
IAGO:
What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
EMILIA:
Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak;
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
OTHELLO:
O! O! O!
EMILIA:
Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye.
OTHELLO:
[Rises.] O, she was foul!
I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece,
Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd.
I know this act shows horrible and grim.
GRATIANO:
Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father's dead.
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain; did he live now,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
And fall to reprobation.
OTHELLO:
'Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand,
It was a handkerchief, an antique token
My father gave my mother.
EMILIA:
O heaven! O heavenly powers!
IAGO:
'Zounds! Hold your peace.
EMILIA:
'Twill out, 'twill. I peace?
No, I will speak as liberal as the north;
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
IAGO:
Be wise, and get you home.
EMILIA:
I will not.
GRATIANO:
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
EMILIA:
O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband,
For often with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.
IAGO:
Villainous whore!
EMILIA:
She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
And I did give't my husband.
IAGO:
Filth, thou liest!
EMILIA:
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murtherous coxcomb! What should such a fool
Do with so good a wife?
OTHELLO:
Are there not stones in heaven
But what serve for thunder? Precious villain!
GRATIANO:
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
EMILIA:
Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.
GRATIANO:
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
MONTANO:
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor.
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
For 'tis a damned slave.
OTHELLO:
I am not valiant neither,
But every puny whipster gets my sword.
But why should honor outlive honesty?
Let it go all.
EMILIA:
What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,
And die in music. "Willow, willow, willow."
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
OTHELLO:
I have another weapon in this chamber;
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper-
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
GRATIANO:
[Within.] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear.
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
OTHELLO:
Look in upon me then, and speak with me,
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
GRATIANO:
What is the matter?
OTHELLO:
Behold, I have a weapon;
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day
That with this little arm and this good sword
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd? 'Tis a lost fear.
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead!
O! O! O!
LODOVICO:
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
OTHELLO:
That's he that was Othello. Here I am.
LODOVICO:
Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
OTHELLO:
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
LODOVICO:
Wrench his sword from him.
IAGO:
I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
OTHELLO:
I am not sorry neither. I'ld have thee live,
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
LODOVICO:
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave,
What shall be said to thee?
OTHELLO:
Why, anything;
An honorable murtherer, if you will,
For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.
LODOVICO:
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
OTHELLO:
Ay.
CASSIO:
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
OTHELLO:
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
IAGO:
Demand me nothing; what you know, you know.
From this time forth I never will speak word.
LODOVICO:
What, not to pray?
GRATIANO:
Torments will ope your lips.
OTHELLO:
Well, thou dost best.
LODOVICO:
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
And here another. The one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo.
OTHELLO:
O villain!
CASSIO:
Most heathenish and most gross!
LODOVICO:
Now here's another discontented paper,
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
But that, belike, Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him.
OTHELLO:
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
That was my wife's?
CASSIO:
I found it in my chamber;
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.
OTHELLO:
O fool! fool! fool!
CASSIO:
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came
That I was cast. And even but now he spake
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.
LODOVICO:
You must forsake this room, and go with us.
Your power and your command is taken off,
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long,
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.
OTHELLO:
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him, thus.
LODOVICO:
O bloody period!
GRATIANO:
All that's spoke is marr'd.
OTHELLO:
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee. No way but this,
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
CASSIO:
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
For he was great of heart.
LODOVICO:
[To Iago.] O Spartan dog,
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
This is thy work. The object poisons sight;
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
For they succeed on you. To you, Lord Governor,
Remains the censure of this hellish villain,
The time, the place, the torture. O, enforce it!
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
KING RICHARD:
Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,
Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
GAUNT:
I have, my liege.
KING RICHARD:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?
GAUNT:
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
On some apparent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your Highness-no inveterate malice.
KING RICHARD:
Then call them to our presence: face to face
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak.
High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire,
In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happy days befall
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
MOWBRAY:
Each day still better other's happiness
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown!
KING RICHARD:
We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
BOLINGBROKE:
First-heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven-
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be so, and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move,
What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.
MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at an to say.
First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
Which else would post until it had return'd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
I do defy him, and I spit at him,
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain;
Which to maintain, I would allow him odds
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or any other ground inhabitable
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Meantime let this defend my loyalty-
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie
BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the King;
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop.
By that and all the rites of knighthood else
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.
MOWBRAY:
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
I'll answer thee in any fair degree
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;
And when I mount, alive may I not light
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
KING RICHARD:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
BOLINGBROKE:
Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true-
That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Besides, I say and will in battle prove-
Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd by English eye-
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say, and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood;
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
KING RICHARD:
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I have told this slander of his blood
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
KING RICHARD:
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and cars.
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my father's brother's son,
Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
MOWBRAY:
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers;
The other part reserv'd I by consent,
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death-
I slew him not, but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
The honourable father to my foe,
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.
This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd,
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
Which in myself I boldly will defend,
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor's foot
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your Highness to assign our trial day.
KING RICHARD:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;
Let's purge this choler without letting blood-
This we prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malice makes too deep incision.
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed:
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall become my age.
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
KING RICHARD:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.
GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should not bid again.
KING RICHARD:
Norfolk, throw down; we bid.
There is no boot.
MOWBRAY:
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot;
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death, that lives upon my grave
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffl'd here;
Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
Which breath'd this poison.
KING RICHARD:
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage-lions make leopards tame.
MOWBRAY:
Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation; that away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;
Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
In that I live, and for that will I die.
KING RICHARD:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
KING RICHARD:
We were not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day.
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate;
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms
Be ready to direct these home alarms.
GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
To stir against the butchers of his life!
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Or seven fair branches springing from one root.
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,
That mettle, that self mould, that fashion'd thee,
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father's death
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt-it is despair;
In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.
That which in mean men we entitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully,
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.
DUCHESS:
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
GAUNT:
To God, the widow's champion and defence.
DUCHESS:
Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom
That they may break his foaming courser's back
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt; thy sometimes brother's wife,
With her companion, Grief, must end her life.
GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
DUCHESS:
Yet one word more- grief boundeth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.
I take my leave before I have begun,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him- ah, what?-
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
MARSHAL:
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
MARSHAL:
The Duke of Norfolk, spightfully and bold,
Stays but the summons of the appelant's trumpet.
AUMERLE:
Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
For nothing but his Majesty's approach.
KING RICHARD:
Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms;
Ask him his name; and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.
MARSHAL:
In God's name and the King's, say who thou art,
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms;
Against what man thou com'st, and what thy quarrel.
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath-
Which God defend a knight should violate!-
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my King, and my succeeding issue,
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me;
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
KING RICHARD:
Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war;
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause.
MARSHAL:
What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
BOLINGBROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
MARSHAL:
On pain of death, no person be so bold
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Except the Marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs.
BOLINGBROKE:
Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his Majesty;
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.
MARSHAL:
The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
KING RICHARD:
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
BOLINGBROKE:
O, let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.
As confident as is the falcon's flight
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although I have to do with death,
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the end
GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-
I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the King
In deadly hate the one against the other;
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-
About a prophecy which says that G
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
That waits upon your Grace?
CLARENCE:
His Majesty,
Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.
GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?
CLARENCE:
Because my name is George.
GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Antony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is delivered?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
Heard you not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?
GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with the King,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
BRAKENBURY:
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with your brother.
GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man; we say the King
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
BRAKENBURY:
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best to do it secretly alone.
BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?
GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
BRAKENBURY:
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
withal
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
CLARENCE:
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
obey.
GLOUCESTER:
We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
GLOUCESTER:
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
I will deliver or else lie for you.
Meantime, have patience.
CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Farewell.
GLOUCESTER:
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
HASTINGS:
More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?
HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home:
The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.
GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long
And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Where is he? In his bed?
HASTINGS:
He is.
GLOUCESTER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live;
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father;
The which will I-not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market.
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
ANNE:
Set down, set down your honourable load-
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
That makes us wretched by the death of thee
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her be made
More miserable by the death of him
Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still as you are weary of this weight
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
ANNE:
What black magician conjures up this fiend
To stop devoted charitable deeds?
GLOUCESTER:
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!
FIRST GENTLEMAN:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
pass.
GLOUCESTER:
Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
ANNE:
What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.
GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
ANNE:
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.
GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
ANNE:
Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
ANNE:
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
GLOUCESTER:
More wonderful when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
By circumstance but to acquit myself.
ANNE:
Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
Of these known evils but to give me leave
By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.
GLOUCESTER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
ANNE:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current but to hang thyself.
GLOUCESTER:
By such despair I should accuse myself.
ANNE:
And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?
ANNE:
Then say they were not slain.
But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your husband.
ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.
GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
ANNE:
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
Didst thou not kill this king?
GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.
ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
GLOUCESTER:
The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
him.
ANNE:
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank me that holp to send him
thither,
For he was fitter for that place than earth.
ANNE:
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
GLOUCESTER:
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
ANNE:
Some dungeon.
GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.
ANNE:
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
ANNE:
I hope so.
GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall something into a slower method-
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?
ANNE:
Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
GLOUCESTER:
Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
ANNE:
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
GLOUCESTER:
These eyes could not endure that beauty's
wreck;
You should not blemish it if I stood by.
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.
ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
ANNE:
I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
GLOUCESTER:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
ANNE:
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
ANNE:
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
GLOUCESTER:
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
ANNE:
Name him.
GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.
ANNE:
Why, that was he.
GLOUCESTER:
The self-same name, but one of better nature.
ANNE:
Where is he?
GLOUCESTER:
Here. Why dost thou spit
at me?
ANNE:
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
GLOUCESTER:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
GLOUCESTER:
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
ANNE:
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
GLOUCESTER:
I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.
ANNE:
Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
I will not be thy executioner.
GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
ANNE:
I have already.
GLOUCESTER:
That was in thy rage.
Speak it again, and even with the word
This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
ANNE:
I would I knew thy heart.
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
ANNE:
I fear me both are false.
GLOUCESTER:
Then never was man true.
ANNE:
well put up your sword.
GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my peace is made.
ANNE:
That shalt thou know hereafter.
GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?
ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.
GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
ANNE:
To take is not to give.
GLOUCESTER:
Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted servant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
ANNE:
What is it?
GLOUCESTER:
That it may please you leave these sad designs
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby House;
Where-after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
I will with all expedient duty see you.
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.
ANNE:
With all my heart; and much it joys me too
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.
ANNE:
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.
GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.
GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
GLOUCESTER:
No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of my hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
And I no friends to back my suit at all
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
The spacious world cannot again afford;
And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
And made her widow to a woeful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while.
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain a score or two of tailors
To study fashions to adorn my body.
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
I will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.
RIVERS:
Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
GREY:
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what would betide on
me?
GREY:
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of such a lord includes all
harms.
GREY:
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, he is young; and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
RIVER:
Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
But so it must be, if the King miscarry.
GREY:
Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
DERBY:
God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
of Derby,
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
Derby?
DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his Majesty.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of his amendment,
Lords?
BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
cheerfully.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God grant him health! Did you confer
with him?
BUCKINGHAM:
Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! But that will
never be.
I fear our happiness is at the height.
GLOUCESTER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
Who is it that complains unto the King
That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
GREY:
To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
GLOUCESTER:
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,
Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-
Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
matter.
The King, on his own royal disposition
And not provok'd by any suitor else-
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred
That in your outward action shows itself
Against my children, brothers, and myself-
Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
Since every Jack became a gentleman,
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning,
brother Gloucester:
You envy my advancement and my friends';
God grant we never may have need of you!
GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
Held in contempt; while great promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that rais'd me to this careful
height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his Majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you were not the mean
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
RIVERS:
She may, my lord; for-
GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high desert.
What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?
GLOUCESTER:
What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
Iwis your grandam had a worser match.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen with this condition-
To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.
Small joy have I in being England's Queen.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And less'ned be that small, God, I
beseech Him!
Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.
GLOUCESTER:
What! Threat you me with telling of the
King?
Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said
I will avouch't in presence of the King.
I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, devil! I do remember them to
well:
Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
King,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
To royalize his blood I spent mine own.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, and much better blood than his or
thine.
GLOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere this, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
QUEEN MARGARET:
A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-
QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!
GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
world,
Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.
RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
So should we you, if you should be our king.
GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy were you this country's king,
As little joy you may suppose in me
That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
QUEEN MARGARET:
As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
sight?
QUEEN MARGARET:
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
That will I make before I let thee go.
GLOUCESTER:
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I was; but I do find more pain in
banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-
His curses then from bitterness of soul
Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God to right the innocent.
HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, were you snarling all before I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,
That none of you may live his natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
GLOUCESTER:
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
hag.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be while some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell,
Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
Thou rag of honour, thou detested-
GLOUCESTER:
Margaret!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!
GLOUCESTER:
Ha?
QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.
GLOUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!
GLOUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breath'd your curse
against yourself.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.
HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon you! you have all
mov'd mine.
RIVERS:
Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me well you all should do me
duty,
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
GLOUCESTER:
Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
DORSET:
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
GLOUCESTER:
Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
QUEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
As it is won with blood, lost be it so!
BUCKINGHAM:
Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame;
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, have done.
QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
hand
In sign of league and amity with thee.
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I will not think but they ascend the sky
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.
GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
counsel,
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
BUCKINGHAM:
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
RIVERS:
And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
GLOUCESTER:
I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I never did her any to my knowledge.
GLOUCESTER:
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;
God pardon them that are the cause thereof!
RIVERS:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever- being well advis'd;
For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.
CATESBY:
Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
with me?
RIVERS:
We wait upon your Grace.
GLOUCESTER:
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls;
Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
Now they believe it, and withal whet me
To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
But, soft, here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
FIRST MURDERER:
We are, my lord, and come to have the
warrant,
That we may be admitted where he is.
GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
FIRST MURDERER:
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
prate;
Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
tears.
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.
FIRST MURDERER:
We will, my noble lord.
KEEPER:
Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
CLARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-
So full of dismal terror was the time!
KEEPER:
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
tell me.
CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And in my company my brother Gloucester,
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
And cited up a thousand heavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,
That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
KEEPER:
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
KEEPER:
Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
CLARENCE:
No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
O, then began the tempest to my soul!
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.
Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made my dream.
KEEPER:
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
CLARENCE:
Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
That now give evidence against my soul
For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
KEEPER:
I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
BRAKENBURY:
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
Princes have but their titles for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And for unfelt imaginations
They often feel a world of restless cares,
So that between their tides and low name
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
FIRST MURDERER:
Ho! who's here?
BRAKENBURY:
What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
thou hither?
FIRST MURDERER:
I would speak with Clarence, and I came
hither on my legs.
BRAKENBURY:
What, so brief?
SECOND MURDERER:
'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
him see our commission and talk no more.
BRAKENBURY:
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
I'll to the King and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
FIRST MURDERER:
You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
you well.
SECOND MURDERER:
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
FIRST MURDERER:
No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
he wakes.
SECOND MURDERER:
Why, he shall never wake until the great
judgment-day.
FIRST MURDERER:
Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
sleeping.
SECOND MURDERER:
The urging of that word judgment hath
bred a kind of remorse in me.
FIRST MURDERER:
What, art thou afraid?
SECOND MURDERER:
Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
defend me.
FIRST MURDERER:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
SECOND MURDERER:
So I am, to let him live.
FIRST MURDERER:
I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
tell him so.
SECOND MURDERER:
Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
hold me but while one tells twenty.
FIRST MURDERER:
How dost thou feel thyself now?
SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
are yet within me.
FIRST MURDERER:
Remember our reward, when the deed's
done.
SECOND MURDERER:
Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
FIRST MURDERER:
Where's thy conscience now?
SECOND MURDERER:
O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
FIRST MURDERER:
When he opens his purse to give us our
reward, thy conscience flies out.
SECOND MURDERER:
'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
none will entertain it.
FIRST MURDERER:
What if it come to thee again?
SECOND MURDERER:
I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
to himself and live without it.
FIRST MURDERER:
Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
persuading me not to kill the Duke.
SECOND MURDERER:
Take the devil in thy mind and believe
him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
sigh.
FIRST MURDERER:
I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
me.
SECOND MURDERER:
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
FIRST MURDERER:
Take him on the costard with the hilts of
thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
next room.
SECOND MURDERER:
O excellent device! and make a sop of
him.
FIRST MURDERER:
Soft! he wakes.
SECOND MURDERER:
Strike!
FIRST MURDERER:
No, we'll reason with him.
CLARENCE:
Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
SECOND MURDERER:
You shall have wine enough, my lord,
anon.
CLARENCE:
In God's name, what art thou?
FIRST MURDERER:
A man, as you are.
CLARENCE:
But not as I am, royal.
SECOND MURDERER:
Nor you as we are, loyal.
CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
FIRST MURDERER:
My voice is now the King's, my looks
mine own.
CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
SECOND MURDERER:
To, to, to-
CLARENCE:
To murder me?
BOTH MURDERERS:
Ay, ay.
CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
FIRST MURDERER:
Offended us you have not, but the King.
CLARENCE:
I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
SECOND MURDERER:
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
CLARENCE:
Are you drawn forth among a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me.
The deed you undertake is damnable.
FIRST MURDERER:
What we will do, we do upon command.
SECOND MURDERER:
And he that hath commanded is our
King.
CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
SECOND MURDERER:
And that same vengeance doth he hurl
on thee
For false forswearing, and for murder too;
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
FIRST MURDERER:
And like a traitor to the name of God
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
SECOND MURDERER:
Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
defend.
FIRST MURDERER:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
to us,
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
CLARENCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
He sends you not to murder me for this,
For in that sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be avenged for the deed,
O, know you yet He doth it publicly.
Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;
He needs no indirect or lawless course
To cut off those that have offended Him.
FIRST MURDERER:
Who made thee then a bloody minister
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
FIRST MURDERER:
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
faults,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
CLARENCE:
If you do love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
SECOND MURDERER:
You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
hates you.
CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
Go you to him from me.
FIRST MURDERER:
Ay, so we will.
CLARENCE:
Tell him when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship.
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
FIRST MURDERER:
Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
FIRST MURDERER:
Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
deceive yourself:
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
That he would labour my delivery.
FIRST MURDERER:
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
SECOND MURDERER:
Make peace with God, for you must die,
my lord.
CLARENCE:
Have you that holy feeling in your souls
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And are you yet to your own souls so blind
That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
SECOND MURDERER:
What shall we do?
CLARENCE:
Relent, and save your souls.
FIRST MURDERER:
Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
CLARENCE:
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty as I am now,
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side and entreat for me-
As you would beg were you in my distress.
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
SECOND MURDERER:
Look behind you, my lord.
FIRST MURDERER:
[Stabbing him]
this will not do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
SECOND MURDERER:
A bloody deed, and desperately
dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous murder!
help'st me not?
By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
been!
SECOND MURDERER:
I would he knew that I had sav'd his
brother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the Duke is slain.
FIRST MURDERER:
So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
And when I have my meed, I will away;
For this will out, and then I must not stay.
KING EDWARD:
Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
work.
You peers, continue this united league.
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
RIVERS:
By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
HASTINGS:
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
KING EDWARD:
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood and award
Either of you to be the other's end.
HASTINGS:
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
RIVERS:
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
KING EDWARD:
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
You have been factious one against the other.
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There, Hastings; I will never more
remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
KING EDWARD:
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
Marquis.
DORSET:
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be inviolable.
HASTINGS:
And so swear I.
KING EDWARD:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.
BUCKINGHAM:
[To the QUEEN]
doth turn his hate
Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend
And most assured that he is a friend,
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
When I am cold in love to you or yours.
KING EDWARD:
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
To make the blessed period of this peace.
BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time,
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.
GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign king and
Queen;
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
KING EDWARD:
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
GLOUCESTER:
A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
Among this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe-
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
To any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
That all without desert have frown'd on me;
Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night.
I thank my God for my humility.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
KING EDWARD:
Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
he is?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
BUCKINGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
KING EDWARD:
Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor man, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear;
Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion!
DERBY:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
KING EDWARD:
I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
DERBY:
I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
KING EDWARD:
Then say at once what is it thou requests.
DERBY:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
KING EDWARD:
Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was bitter death.
Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his garments, and did give himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much race to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.
But for my brother not a man would speak;
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!
GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the King!
God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
To comfort Edward with our company?
BUCKINGHAM:
We wait upon your Grace.
SON:
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
DUCHESS:
No, boy.
DAUGHTER:
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
SON:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
If that our noble father were alive?
DUCHESS:
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
I do lament the sickness of the King,
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
SON:
Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With earnest prayers all to that effect.
DAUGHTER:
And so will I.
DUCHESS:
Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
well.
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
SON:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as a child.
DUCHESS:
Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
SON:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
DUCHESS:
Ay, boy.
SON:
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul
And to myself become an enemy.
DUCHESS:
What means this scene of rude impatience?
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an act of tragic violence.
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
Or like obedient subjects follow him
To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
DUCHESS:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And liv'd with looking on his images;
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
And hast the comfort of thy children left;
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
SON:
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
DAUGHTER:
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
CHILDREN:
Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
DUCHESS:
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What stay had I but Edward? and he's
gone.
CHILDREN:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
DUCHESS:
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Was never widow had so dear a loss.
CHILDREN:
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
DUCHESS:
Was never mother had so dear a loss.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentation.
DORSET:
Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
GLOUCESTER:
Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can help our harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.
DUCHESS:
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
GLOUCESTER:
Amen! And make me die a good old
man!
That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
BUCKINGHAM:
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
peers,
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love.
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.
Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.
RIVERS:
Why with some little train, my Lord of
Buckingham?
BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
Where every horse bears his commanding rein
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
GLOUCESTER:
I hope the King made peace with all of us;
And the compact is firm and true in me.
RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
HASTINGS:
And so say I.
GLOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
To give your censures in this business?
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
For by the way I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
fast?
SECOND CITIZEN:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
Hear you the news abroad?
FIRST CITIZEN:
Yes, that the King is dead.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
better.
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Neighbours, God speed!
FIRST CITIZEN:
Give you good morrow, sir.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
death?
SECOND CITIZEN:
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
THIRD CITIZEN:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous
world.
FIRST CITIZEN:
No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
reign.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
SECOND CITIZEN:
In him there is a hope of government,
Which, in his nonage, council under him,
And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
FIRST CITIZEN:
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,
God wot;
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the King
Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Why, so hath this, both by his father and
mother.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Better it were they all came by his father,
Or by his father there were none at all;
For emulation who shall now be nearest
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.
FIRST CITIZEN:
Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
well.
THIRD CITIZEN:
When clouds are seen, wise men put on
their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
SECOND CITIZEN:
Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
You cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
THIRD CITIZEN:
Before the days of change, still is it so;
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
But leave it all to God. Whither away?
SECOND CITIZEN:
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
THIRD CITIZEN:
And so was I; I'll bear you company.
ARCHBISHOP:
Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
To-morrow or next day they will be here.
DUCHESS:
I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear no; they say my son of York
Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
YORK:
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
DUCHESS:
Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
YORK:
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.
DUCHESS:
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee.
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely
That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
ARCHBISHOP:
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
DUCHESS:
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
YORK:
Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
DUCHESS:
How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
YORK:
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
DUCHESS:
I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.
DUCHESS:
His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
born.
YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
shrewd.
ARCHBISHOP:
Good madam, be not angry with the child.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.
ARCHBISHOP:
Here comes a messenger. What news?
MESSENGER:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How doth the Prince?
MESSENGER:
Well, madam, and in health.
DUCHESS:
What is thy news?
MESSENGER:
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
DUCHESS:
Who hath committed them?
MESSENGER:
The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
ARCHBISHOP:
For what offence?
MESSENGER:
The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
Why or for what the nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end
SAMP:
Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
GREG:
No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMP:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
GREG:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
SAMP:
I strike quickly, being moved.
GREG:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMP:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREG:
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
SAMP:
A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the
wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
GREG:
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
wall.
SAMP:
'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are
ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
GREG:
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMP:
'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought
with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
their heads.
GREG:
The heads of the maids?
SAMP:
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
GREG:
They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMP:
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREG:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been
poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
Montagues.
SAMP:
My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
GREG:
How? turn thy back and run?
SAMP:
Fear me not.
GREG:
No, marry. I fear thee!
SAMP:
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
GREG:
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
SAMP:
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
disgrace to them, if they bear it.
ABR:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMP:
I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABR:
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMP:
[aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
GREG:
[aside to Sampson] No.
SAMP:
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
thumb, sir.
GREG:
Do you quarrel, sir?
ABR:
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
SAMP:
But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
ABR:
No better.
SAMP:
Well, sir.
GREG:
[aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
master's kinsmen.
SAMP:
Yes, better, sir.
ABR:
You lie.
SAMP:
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
BEN:
Part, fools!
Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
TYB:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
BEN:
I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYB:
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Have at thee, coward!
OFFICER:
Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
CITIZENS:
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
CAP:
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
WIFE:
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
CAP:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
MON:
Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away.
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
MON:
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BEN:
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BEN:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I- measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self-
Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
MON:
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest East bean to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BEN:
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MON:
I neither know it nor can learn of him
BEN:
Have you importun'd him by any means?
MON:
Both by myself and many other friend;
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself- I will not say how true-
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
BEN:
See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
MON:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
BEN:
Good morrow, cousin.
ROM:
Is the day so young?
BEN:
But new struck nine.
ROM:
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BEN:
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROM:
Not having that which having makes them short.
BEN:
In love?
ROM:
Out-
BEN:
Of love?
ROM:
Out of her favour where I am in love.
BEN:
Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
ROM:
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
BEN:
No, coz, I rather weep.
ROM:
Good heart, at what?
BEN:
At thy good heart's oppression.
ROM:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
BEN:
Soft! I will go along.
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROM:
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
BEN:
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
ROM:
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BEN:
Groan? Why, no;
But sadly tell me who.
ROM:
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BEN:
I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
ROM:
A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
BEN:
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROM:
Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
BEN:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROM:
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
BEN:
Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
ROM:
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
BEN:
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.
ROM:
'Tis the way
To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
BEN:
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
CAP:
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PAR:
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAP:
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PAR:
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAP:
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
My will to her consent is but a part.
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be;
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
Come, go with me. Go, sirrah,
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
SERV:
Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with
his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath
here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
BEN:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROM:
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
BEN:
For what, I pray thee?
ROM:
For your broken shin.
BEN:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROM:
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
SERV:
God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
ROM:
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
SERV:
Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can you
read anything you see?
ROM:
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
SERV:
Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
ROM:
Stay, fellow; I can read.
SERV:
Up.
ROM:
Whither?
SERV:
To supper, to our house.
ROM:
Whose house?
SERV:
My master's.
ROM:
Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
SERV:
Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich
Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come
and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!
BEN:
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go thither, and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROM:
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
BEN:
Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
ROM:
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
WIFE:
Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
NURSE:
Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
JUL:
How now? Who calls?
NURSE:
Your mother.
JUL:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?
WIFE:
This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
NURSE:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
WIFE:
She's not fourteen.
NURSE:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammastide?
WIFE:
A fortnight and odd days.
NURSE:
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But, as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
My lord and you were then at Mantua.
Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years,
For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow;
And then my husband (God be with his soul!
'A was a merry man) took up the child.
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
To see now how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
WIFE:
Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
NURSE:
Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
JUL:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
NURSE:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
WIFE:
Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?
JUL:
It is an honour that I dream not of.
NURSE:
An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
WIFE:
Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers. By my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
NURSE:
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
WIFE:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
NURSE:
Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
WIFE:
What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast.
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes,
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him only lacks a cover.
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide.
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him making yourself no less.
NURSE:
No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
WIFE:
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
JUL:
I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
SERV:
Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my
young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
follow straight.
WIFE:
We follow thee.
Juliet, the County stays.
NURSE:
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
ROM:
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?
BEN:
The date is out of such prolixity.
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance;
But, let them measure us by what they will,
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROM:
Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
MER:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROM:
Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MER:
You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
And soar with them above a common bound.
ROM:
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
MER:
And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROM:
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
MER:
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in.
A visor for a visor! What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
BEN:
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs.
ROM:
A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
MER:
Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
ROM:
Nay, that's not so.
MER:
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROM:
And we mean well, in going to this masque;
But 'tis no wit to go.
MER:
Why, may one ask?
ROM:
I dreamt a dream to-night.
MER:
And so did I.
ROM:
Well, what was yours?
MER:
That dreamers often lie.
ROM:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MER:
O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate stone
On the forefinger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she 'gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice.
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage.
This is she-
ROM:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.
MER:
True, I talk of dreams;
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the North
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
BEN:
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROM:
I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
BEN:
Strike, drum.
He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Anthony, and Potpan!
for, in the great chamber.
Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
Enter the Maskers, Enter, Capulet, his Wife,
CAP:
Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days.
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
CAP:
What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
His son is thirty.
CAP:
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROM:
[to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
SERV:
I know not, sir.
ROM:
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
TYB:
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
CAP:
Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
TYB:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain, that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAP:
Young Romeo is it?
TYB:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
CAP:
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYB:
It fits when such a villain is a guest.
I'll not endure him.
CAP:
He shall be endur'd.
What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
TYB:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAP:
Go to, go to!
You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
TYB:
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.
ROM:
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JUL:
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROM:
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JUL:
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
ROM:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JUL:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROM:
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
JUL:
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROM:
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
Give me my sin again.
JUL:
You kiss by th' book.
NURSE:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROM:
What is her mother?
NURSE:
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house.
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
ROM:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
BEN:
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
ROM:
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
CAP:
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
I'll to my rest.
JUL:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
NURSE:
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JUL:
What's he that now is going out of door?
NURSE:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
JUL:
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
NURSE:
I know not.
JUL:
Go ask his name.- If he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
NURSE:
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of your great enemy.
JUL:
My only love, sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy.
NURSE:
What's this? what's this?
JUL:
A rhyme I learnt even now
Of one I danc'd withal.
NURSE:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
CHOR:
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere;
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
ROM:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
BEN:
Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
MER:
He is wise,
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
BEN:
He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
Call, good Mercutio.
MER:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
BEN:
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MER:
This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
That were some spite; my invocation
Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
BEN:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
MER:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?
BEN:
Go then, for 'tis in vain
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
ROM:
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
JUL:
Ay me!
ROM:
She speaks.
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JUL:
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
ROM:
[aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JUL:
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
ROM:
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JUL:
What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
So stumblest on my counsel?
ROM:
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JUL:
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
ROM:
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
JUL:
How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROM:
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
JUL:
If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
ROM:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
JUL:
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROM:
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JUL:
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROM:
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
JUL:
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROM:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
JUL:
O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROM:
What shall I swear by?
JUL:
Do not swear at all;
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
ROM:
If my heart's dear love-
JUL:
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night.
It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
ROM:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JUL:
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROM:
Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JUL:
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.
ROM:
Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
JUL:
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
ROM:
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
JUL:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
NURSE:
(within) Madam!
JUL:
I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee-
NURSE:
(within) Madam!
JUL:
By-and-by I come.-
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
To-morrow will I send.
ROM:
So thrive my soul-
JUL:
A thousand times good night!
ROM:
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
JUL:
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
Romeo!
ROM:
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!
JUL:
Romeo!
ROM:
My dear?
JUL:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?
ROM:
By the hour of nine.
JUL:
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROM:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JUL:
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
ROM:
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
JUL:
'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROM:
I would I were thy bird.
JUL:
Sweet, so would I.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
ROM:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
FRIAR:
The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find;
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
And vice sometime's by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
ROM:
Good morrow, father.
FRIAR:
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distempered head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
ROM:
That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR:
God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
ROM:
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
FRIAR:
That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
ROM:
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR:
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROM:
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
FRIAR:
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
ROM:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR:
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROM:
And bad'st me bury love.
FRIAR:
Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.
ROM:
I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.
FRIAR:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come go with me.
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
ROM:
O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
FRIAR:
Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
MER:
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?
BEN:
Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
MER:
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
BEN:
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
MER:
A challenge, on my life.
BEN:
Romeo will answer it.
MER:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BEN:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being
dared.
MER:
Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft;
and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
BEN:
Why, what is Tybalt?
MER:
More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman of
the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
BEN:
The what?
MER:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes- these
new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very tall
man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand so
much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
bench? O, their bones, their bones!
BEN:
Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
MER:
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art
thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed
in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she had a
better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.
ROM:
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MER:
The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
ROM:
Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MER:
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
man to bow in the hams.
ROM:
Meaning, to cursy.
MER:
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROM:
A most courteous exposition.
MER:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROM:
Pink for flower.
MER:
Right.
ROM:
Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
MER:
Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy
pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
ROM:
O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
MER:
Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
ROM:
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
MER:
Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for thou
hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I
have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
ROM:
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there
for the goose.
MER:
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROM:
Nay, good goose, bite not!
MER:
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
ROM:
And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
MER:
O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
narrow to an ell broad!
ROM:
I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to the
goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
MER:
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art
thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
a hole.
BEN:
Stop there, stop there!
MER:
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BEN:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MER:
O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I was
come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy
the argument no longer.
ROM:
Here's goodly gear!
MER:
A sail, a sail!
BEN:
Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
NURSE:
Peter!
PETER:
Anon.
NURSE:
My fan, Peter.
MER:
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
the two.
NURSE:
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MER:
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
NURSE:
Is it good-den?
MER:
'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now
upon the prick of noon.
NURSE:
Out upon you! What a man are you!
ROM:
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
NURSE:
By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,' quoth
'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young
Romeo?
ROM:
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you have
found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of
that name, for fault of a worse.
NURSE:
You say well.
MER:
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
wisely.
NURSE:
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
BEN:
She will endite him to some supper.
MER:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
ROM:
What hast thou found?
MER:
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
something stale and hoar ere it be spent
Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
ROM:
I will follow you.
MER:
Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
NURSE:
Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant was
this that was so full of his ropery?
ROM:
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and will
speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
NURSE:
An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an 'a
were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand
by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
PETER:
I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as soon
as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law
on my side.
NURSE:
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I will
keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her
into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an
ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
ROM:
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
thee-
NURSE:
Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
ROM:
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
NURSE:
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take
it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
ROM:
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
NURSE:
No, truly, sir; not a penny.
ROM:
Go to! I say you shall.
NURSE:
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
ROM:
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
NURSE:
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
ROM:
What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
NURSE:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROM:
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
NURSE:
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good
soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger
her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but
I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout
in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with
a letter?
ROM:
Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
NURSE:
Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I know
it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.
ROM:
Commend me to thy lady.
NURSE:
Ay, a thousand times. Peter!
PETER:
Anon.
NURSE:
Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
JUL:
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
NURSE:
Peter, stay at the gate.
JUL:
Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
NURSE:
I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
JUL:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
NURSE:
Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
JUL:
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
NURSE:
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than
any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet they
are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God.
What, have you din'd at home?
JUL:
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that?
NURSE:
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
JUL:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
NURSE:
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where is
your mother?
JUL:
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
NURSE:
O God's Lady dear!
Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JUL:
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
NURSE:
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JUL:
I have.
NURSE:
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
JUL:
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
FRIAR:
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
ROM:
Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRIAR:
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
JUL:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
FRIAR:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JUL:
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROM:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JUL:
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRIAR:
Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
BEN:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MER:
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the
confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says
'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second
cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BEN:
Am I like such a fellow?
MER:
Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
moved.
BEN:
And what to?
MER:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for
one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man
that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other
reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye
would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as
an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a man
for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that
hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with another
for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!
BEN:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy
the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MER:
The fee simple? O simple!
BEN:
By my head, here come the Capulets.
MER:
By my heel, I care not.
TYB:
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
MER:
And but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
TYB:
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
occasion.
MER:
Could you not take some occasion without giving
TYB:
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
MER:
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
BEN:
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
MER:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
TYB:
Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
MER:
But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
Your worship in that sense may call him man.
TYB:
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: thou art a villain.
ROM:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
TYB:
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
ROM:
I do protest I never injur'd thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
And so good Capulet, which name I tender
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
MER:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
TYB:
What wouldst thou have with me?
MER:
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. That I
mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of
his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.
TYB:
I am for you.
ROM:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MER:
Come, sir, your passado!
ROM:
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
MER:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone and hath nothing?
BEN:
What, art thou hurt?
MER:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
ROM:
Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
MER:
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a
villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
ROM:
I thought all for the best.
MER:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
And soundly too. Your houses!
ROM:
This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
BEN:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROM:
This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end.
BEN:
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROM:
Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
TYB:
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
ROM:
This shall determine that.
BEN:
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
ROM:
O, I am fortune's fool!
BEN:
Why dost thou stay?
CITIZEN:
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
BEN:
There lies that Tybalt.
CITIZEN:
Up, sir, go with me.
I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
PRINCE:
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BEN:
O noble Prince. I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
CAP:
Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!
PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BEN:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
CAP:
Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
PRINCE:
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MON:
Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
PRINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
JUL:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the West
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
NURSE:
Ay, ay, the cords.
JUL:
Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
NURSE:
Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
JUL:
Can heaven be so envious?
NURSE:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
JUL:
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
NURSE:
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
JUL:
O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
NURSE:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
JUL:
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?
NURSE:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
JUL:
O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
NURSE:
It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
JUL:
O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
NURSE:
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!
JUL:
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
NURSE:
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JUL:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
NURSE:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
JUL:
Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
NURSE:
Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
JUL:
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
FRIAR:
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.
ROM:
Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
That I yet know not?
FRIAR:
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
ROM:
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
FRIAR:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
ROM:
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
FRIAR:
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROM:
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR:
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
ROM:
'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not- he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
They are free men, but I am banished.
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
FRIAR:
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
ROM:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRIAR:
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROM:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
FRIAR:
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
ROM:
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRIAR:
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROM:
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
FRIAR:
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROM:
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
FRIAR:
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;
Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
NURSE:
[within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
I come from Lady Juliet.
FRIAR:
Welcome then.
NURSE:
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
FRIAR:
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
NURSE:
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case!
FRIAR:
O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament!
NURSE:
Even so lies she,
Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROM:
(rises) Nurse-
NURSE:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy,
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
Here let us breathe, and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay awhile; what company is this?
TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
GREMIO:
To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
KATHERINA:
[To BAPTISTA]
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KATHERINA:
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
HORTENSIO:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
GREMIO:
And me, too, good Lord!
TRANIO:
Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
LUCENTIO:
But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!
TRANIO:
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said- Bianca, get you in;
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
KATHERINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
BIANCA:
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look, and practise by myself.
LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.
GREMIO:
Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
Go in, Bianca.
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing-up;
And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
KATHERINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,
I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!
GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,
Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly
out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the love
I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man
to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her
father.
HORTENSIO:
SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though
the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now, upon
advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to
our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
labour and effect one thing specially.
GREMIO:
What's that, I pray?
HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
GREMIO:
A husband? a devil.
HORTENSIO:
I say a husband.
GREMIO:
I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father
be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to
endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the
world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
faults, and money enough.
GREMIO:
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this
condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping
Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free
for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
Signior Gremio?
GREMIO:
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in
Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her,
and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
TRANIO:
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?
LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely.
But see! while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
TRANIO:
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart;
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
LUCENTIO:
O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
TRANIO:
Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
And with her breath she did perfume the air;
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
TRANIO:
Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
That, till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advis'd he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tranio.
TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine first.
TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster,
And undertake the teaching of the maid-
That's your device.
LUCENTIO:
It is. May it be done?
TRANIO:
Not possible; for who shall bear your part
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
LUCENTIO:
Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master. Then it follows thus:
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
I will some other be- some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
TRANIO:
So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient-
For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?
Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life.
You understand me?
BIONDELLO:
I, sir? Ne'er a whit.
LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.
BIONDELLO:
The better for him; would I were so too!
TRANIO:
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go.
One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-
Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty.
FIRST SERVANT:
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes there
any more of it?
PAGE:
My lord, 'tis but begun.
SLY:
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
Would 'twere done!
PETRUCHIO:
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua; but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
GRUMIO:
Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?
Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?
PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I
should knock you here, sir?
PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.
PETRUCHIO:
Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.
GRUMIO:
Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
PETRUCHIO:
Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my
good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.
HORTENSIO:
Alla nostra casa ben venuto,
Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If this
be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you, sir:
he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit
for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I
see, two and thirty, a pip out?
Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
PETRUCHIO:
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words
plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'?
PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.
Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though
she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing
comes amiss, so money comes withal.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is- that she is intolerable curst,
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
For I will board her though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman;
Her name is Katherina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
PETRUCHIO:
I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.
GRUMIO:
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my
word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once, he'll
rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she stand
him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so
disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
And her withholds from me, and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
Supposing it a thing impossible-
For those defects I have before rehears'd-
That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
GRUMIO:
Katherine the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
And unsuspected court her by herself.
GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the
young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about
you. Who goes there, ha?
HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio,
stand by awhile.
GRUMIO:
A proper stripling, and an amorous!
GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her.
You understand me- over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfum'd;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
As firmly as yourself were still in place;
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!
GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
PETRUCHIO:
Peace, sirrah!
HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum!
God save you, Signior Gremio!
GREMIO:
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promis'd to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man; for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
GREMIO:
Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.
HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
PETRUCHIO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.
GREMIO:
O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?
PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?
GRUMIO:
Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a fariner's fire?
Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.
GRUMIO:
For he fears none.
GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
HORTENSIO:
I promis'd we would be contributors
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
GREMIO:
And so we will- provided that he win her.
GRUMIO:
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO
TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?
TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.
GREMIO:
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
TRANIO:
Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
TRANIO:
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
LUCENTIO:
[Aside]
HORTENSIO:
Sir, a word ere you go.
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
GREMIO:
No; if without more words you will get you hence.
TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?
GREMIO:
But so is not she.
TRANIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?
GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
HORTENSIO:
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
TRANIO:
Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right- hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown,
And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
GREMIO:
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
TRANIO:
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
GREMIO:
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed.
The younger then is free, and not before.
TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access- whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
HORTENSIO:
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.
TRANIO:
Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
And do as adversaries do in law-
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
HORTENSIO:
The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
BIANCA:
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-
That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.
KATHERINA:
Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.
BIANCA:
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.
KATHERINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
KATHERINA:
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while.
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
KATHERINA:
[Strikes her]
BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
KATHERINA:
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.
BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
KATHERINA:
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?
But who comes here?
as LUCENTIO, with his boy, BIONDELLO, bearing a lute and books
GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!
PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?
BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
GREMIO:
You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
BAPTISTA:
Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to part with her;
Or else you like not of my company.
BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.
BAPTISTA:
I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
Bacare! you are marvellous forward.
PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
GREMIO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young
scholar that hath been long studying at
Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the
other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept
his service.
BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request-
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
And free access and favour as the rest.
And toward the education of your daughters
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa. By report
I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both
These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
PETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
BAPTISTA:
After my death, the one half of my lands
And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
PETRUCHIO:
And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.
BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together,
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
So I to her, and so she yields to me;
For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.
BAPTISTA:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
That shake not though they blow perpetually.
BAPTISTA:
How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
HORTENSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
BAPTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
BAPTISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'
And with that word she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
As she had studied to misuse me so.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I'll attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.
Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week;
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
But here she comes; :Lnd.now, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
KATHERINA:
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
KATHERINA:
Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?
KATHERINA:
A join'd-stool.
PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
KATHERINA:
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
KATHERINA:
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
PETRUCHIO:
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
For, knowing thee to be but young and light-
KATHERINA:
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should- buzz!
KATHERINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO:
O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
KATHERINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KATHERINA:
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then to pluck it out.
KATHERINA:
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
In his tail.
KATHERINA:
In his tongue.
PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?
KATHERINA:
Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
KATHERINA:
That I'll try.
PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
KATHERINA:
So may you lose your arms.
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
KATHERINA:
What is your crest- a coxcomb?
PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
KATHERINA:
No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
KATHERINA:
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
KATHERINA:
There is, there is.
PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.
KATHERINA:
Had I a glass I would.
PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?
KATHERINA:
Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KATHERINA:
Yet you are wither'd.
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.
KATHERINA:
I care not.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
KATHERINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
KATHERINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
KATHERINA:
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRUCHIO:
It is extempore, from my mother wit.
KATHERINA:
A witty mother! witless else her son.
PETRUCHIO:
Am I not wise?
KATHERINA:
Yes, keep you warm.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father. Never make denial;
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
PETRUCHIO:
How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?
KATHERINA:
Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
KATHERINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
BAPTISTA:
I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.
PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
We will have rings and things, and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
BAPTISTA:
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for;
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
TRANIO:
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRANIO:
Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.
TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
GREMIO:
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.
TRANIO:
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son;
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good
Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
That she shall have, besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road.
What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
GREMIO:
Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have;
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
And let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
If you should die before him, where's her dower?
TRANIO:
That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
GREMIO:
And may not young men die as well as old?
BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katherine is to be married;
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
If not, to Signior Gremio.
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now, I fear thee not.
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
TRANIO:
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?
HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony.
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
LUCENTIO:
Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause serve in your harmony.
HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BIANCA:
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.
HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
LUCENTIO:
That will be never- tune your instrument.
BIANCA:
Where left we last?
LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
BIANCA:
Construe them.
LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am Lucentio-
'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus' disguised
thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that
comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my
port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois' I
know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic
steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume not-
HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.
LUCENTIO:
All but the bass.
HORTENSIO:
The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
BIANCA:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
HORTENSIO:
[To LUCENTIO]
My lessons make no music in three Parts.
LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
HORTENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art,
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
BIANCA:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
BIANCA:
[Reads]
Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
To change true rules for odd inventions.
SERVANT:
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
HORTENSIO:
But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-
Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
HORTENSIO WILL BE QUIT WITH THEE BY CHANGING:
Exit
BAPTISTA:
[To TRANIO]
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? What mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
KATHERINA:
No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'
TRANIO:
Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
KATHERINA:
Would Katherine had never seen him though!
BAPTISTA:
Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
For such an injury would vex a very saint;
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard of!
BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? How may that be?
BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
BAPTISTA:
Is he come?
BIONDELLO:
Why, no, sir.
BAPTISTA:
What then?
BIONDELLO:
He is coming.
BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?
BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
TRANIO:
But, say, what to thine old news?
BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an old
rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt,
and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with an
old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess'd
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with
the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped
with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway'd in
the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a
half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often
burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec'd,
and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her
name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with
pack-thread.
BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?
BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like
the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose
on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and
the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.
BAPTISTA:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.
BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not say he comes?
BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?
BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.
BIONDELLO:
No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.
BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.
PETRUCHIO:
And yet I come not well.
BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt not.
TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.
PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?
BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
TRANIO:
And tell us what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress,
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
TRANIO:
See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
BAPTISTA:
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words;
To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
TRANIO:
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.
BAPTISTA:
I'll after him and see the event of this.
TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth us to ad
Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
As I before imparted to your worship,
I am to get a man- whate'er he be
It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
TRANIO:
That by degrees we mean to look into
And watch our vantage in this business;
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRANIO:
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
GREMIO:
A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
TRANIO:
Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
GREMIO:
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
TRANIO:
What said the wench, when he rose again?
GREMIO:
Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been abroad, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck,
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo.
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before.
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day before night come.
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.
GREMIO:
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.
KATHERINA:
Let me entreat you.
PETRUCHIO:
I am content.
KATHERINA:
Are you content to stay?
PETRUCHIO:
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
KATHERINA:
Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.
GRUMIO:
Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
KATHERINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
PETRUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
KATHERINA:
I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
GREMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
KATHERINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
I see a woman may be made a fool
If she had not a spirit to resist.
PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own-
She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
I'll buckler thee against a million.
BAPTISTA:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GREMIO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRANIO:
Of all mad matches, never was the like.
LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all
foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was
ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are
coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof
of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to
thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
Holla, ho! Curtis!
CURTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?
GRUMIO:
A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
neck. A fire, good Curtis.
CURTIS:
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
water.
CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st
winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old
master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
CURTIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
GRUMIO:
Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long
am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain
on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand- thou
shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot
office?
CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
GRUMIO:
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and
mistress are almost frozen to death.
CURTIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
CURTIS:
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
GRUMIO:
Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes
strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,
their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets
laid, and everything in order?
CURTIS:
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GRUMIO:
First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n
out.
CURTIS:
How?
GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a
tale.
CURTIS:
Let's ha't, good Grumio.
GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.
CURTIS:
Here.
GRUMIO:
There.
CURTIS:
This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GRUMIO:
And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this cuff
was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I begin:
Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
mistress-
CURTIS:
Both of one horse?
GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?
CURTIS:
Why, a horse.
GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse;
thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never pray'd
before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was
burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc'd to
thy grave.
CURTIS:
By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
GRUMIO:
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find
when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth
Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the
rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats brush'd
and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with
their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my mastcr's
horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
CURTIS:
They are.
GRUMIO:
Call them forth.
CURTIS:
Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my
mistress.
GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her own.
CURTIS:
Who knows not that?
GRUMIO:
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.
GRUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!
PHILIP:
How now, Grumio!
JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!
NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumio!
NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad!
GRUMIO:
Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!- and
thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready,
and all things neat?
NATHANIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?
GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
ALL SERVANTS:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.
PETRUCHIO:
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
PETRUCHIO:
YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
KATHERINA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?
What's this? Mutton?
FIRST SERVANT:
Ay.
PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?
PETER:
I.
PETRUCHIO:
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
KATHERINA:
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
And for this night we'll fast for company.
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever see the like?
PETER:
He kills her in her own humour.
GRUMIO:
Where is he?
CURTIS:
In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her-
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.
TRANIO:
Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
BIANCA:
What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
LUCENTIO:
I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
BIANCA:
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
LUCENTIO:
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
HORTENSIO:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca
Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
TRANIO:
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
HORTENSIO:
Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
Nor a musician as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman
And makes a god of such a cullion.
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
HORTENSIO:
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
TRANIO:
And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!
HORTENSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealtlly widow
Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.
TRANIO:
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.
LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.
TRANIO:
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.
BIANCA:
God give him joy!
TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.
BIANCA:
He says so, Tranio.
TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
BIANCA:
The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
TRANIO:
Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
BIONDELLO:
O master, master, have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill
Will serve the turn.
TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
I know not what; but formal in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.
LUCENTIO:
And what of him, Tranio?
TRANIO:
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
PEDANT:
God save you, sir!
TRANIO:
And you, sir; you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
PEDANT:
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?
PEDANT:
Of Mantua.
TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
And come to Padua, careless of your life!
PEDANT:
My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
PEDANT:
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence, and must here deliver them.
TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you-
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
PEDANT:
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vincentio?
PEDANT:
I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
TRANIO:
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
BIONDELLO:
[Aside]
one.
TRANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
Look that you take upon you as you should.
You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city.
If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
PEDANT:
O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.
TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand:
My father is here look'd for every day
To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
KATHERINA:
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars that come unto my father's door
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
And that which spites me more than all these wants-
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?
KATHERINA:
'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
KATHERINA:
I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
GRUMIO:
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
KATHERINA:
A dish that I do love to feed upon.
GRUMIO:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
KATHERINA:
Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
GRUMIO:
Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
KATHERINA:
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
GRUMIO:
Why then the mustard without the beef.
KATHERINA:
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.
PETRUCHIO:
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
HORTENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?
KATHERINA:
Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.
KATHERINA:
I pray you, let it stand.
PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
KATHERINA:
I thank you, sir.
HORTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
PETRUCHIO:
[Aside]
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
Will we return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the gown.
What news with you, sir?
HABERDASHER:
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.
KATHERINA:
I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
PETRUCHIO:
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.
HORTENSIO:
[Aside]
KATHERINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
KATHERINA:
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.
PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
HORTENSIO:
[Aside]
TAILOR:
You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.
PETRUCHIO:
Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.
KATHERINA:
I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
TAILOR:
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-
Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
TAILOR:
Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
Just as my master had direction.
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
GRUMIO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
TAILOR:
But how did you desire it should be made?
GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
TAILOR:
But did you not request to have it cut?
GRUMIO:
Thou hast fac'd many things.
TAILOR:
I have.
GRUMIO:
Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy
master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.
Ergo, thou liest.
TAILOR:
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
PETRUCHIO:
Read it.
GRUMIO:
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
TAILOR:
[Reads]
GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread; I
said a gown.
PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.
TAILOR:
[Reads]
GRUMIO:
I confess the cape.
TAILOR:
[Reads]
GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.
TAILOR:
[Reads]
PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villainy.
GRUMIO:
Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the
sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll
prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
TAILOR:
This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou
shouldst know it.
GRUMIO:
I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
meteyard, and spare not me.
HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
GRUMIO:
You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
PETRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GRUMIO:
Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown for
thy master's use!
PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GRUMIO:
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O fie, fie, fie!
PETRUCHIO:
[Aside]
Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
Away, I say; commend me to thy master.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments;
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What, is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his feathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.
KATHERINA:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
PETRUCHIO:
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
HORTENSIO:
Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
PEDANT:
Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
Signior Baptista may remember me
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as longeth to a father.
PEDANT:
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.
TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not me.
TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
TRANIO:
Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
I pray you stand good father to me now;
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
PEDANT:
Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself;
And- for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him- to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,
To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done-
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
TRANIO:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
BAPTISTA:
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
And happily we might be interrupted.
TRANIO:
Then at my lodging, an it like you.
There doth my father lie; and there this night
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
BAPTISTA:
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
BIONDELLO:
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
TRANIO:
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
BAPTISTA:
I follow you.
BIONDELLO:
Cambio.
LUCENTIO:
What say'st thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
LUCENTIO:
Biondello, what of that?
BIONDELLO:
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
LUCENTIO:
I pray thee moralize them.
BIONDELLO:
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
father of a deceitful son.
LUCENTIO:
And what of him?
BIONDELLO:
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
LUCENTIO:
And then?
BIONDELLO:
The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
at all hours.
LUCENTIO:
And what of all this?
BIONDELLO:
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio
ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk, and
some sufficient honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
LUCENTIO:
Hear'st thou, Biondello?
BIONDELLO:
I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so
may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to
go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you
come with your appendix.
LUCENTIO:
I may and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
PETRUCHIO:
Come on, a God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
KATHERINA:
The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KATHERINA:
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRUCHIO:
Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
HORTENSIO:
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
KATHERINA:
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRUCHIO:
I say it is the moon.
KATHERINA:
I know it is the moon.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
KATHERINA:
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,
And so it shall be so for Katherine.
HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
PETRUCHIO:
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! Company is coming here.
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
HORTENSIO:
'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
KATHERINA:
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man whom favourable stars
Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
PETRUCHIO:
Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
KATHERINA:
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green;
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
PETRUCHIO:
Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
Which way thou travellest- if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.
VINCENTIO:
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
PETRUCHIO:
What is his name?
VINCENTIO:
Lucentio, gentle sir.
PETRUCHIO:
Happily met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
VINCENTIO:
But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?
HORTENSIO:
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
PETRUCHIO:
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
HORTENSIO:
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow; and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
BIONDELLO:
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
LUCENTIO:
I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at
home, therefore leave us.
BIONDELLO:
Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and then
come back to my master's as soon as I can.
GREMIO:
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
PETRUCHIO:
Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
VINCENTIO:
You shall not choose but drink before you go;
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.
GREMIO:
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
PEDANT:
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
VINCENTIO:
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
PEDANT:
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
VINCENTIO:
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make
merry withal?
PEDANT:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so
long as I live.
PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do
you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell
Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here
at the door to speak with him.
PEDANT:
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking
out at the window.
VINCENTIO:
Art thou his father?
PEDANT:
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
PETRUCHIO:
[To VINCENTIO]
Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.
PEDANT:
Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
somebody in this city under my countenance.
BIONDELLO:
I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em
good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio! Now we
are undone and brought to nothing.
VINCENTIO:
[Seeing BIONDELLO]
BIONDELLO:
I hope I may choose, sir.
VINCENTIO:
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
BIONDELLO:
Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never
saw you before in all my life.
VINCENTIO:
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy
master's father, Vincentio?
BIONDELLO:
What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see
where he looks out of the window.
VINCENTIO:
Is't so, indeed?
BIONDELLO:
Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
PEDANT:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
PETRUCHIO:
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end
MASTER:
Boatswain!
BOATSWAIN:
Here, master; what cheer?
MASTER:
Good! Speak to th' mariners; fall to't yarely, or
we run ourselves aground; bestir, bestir.
BOATSWAIN:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th' master's
whistle. Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough.
ALONSO:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
Play the men.
BOATSWAIN:
I pray now, keep below.
ANTONIO:
Where is the master, boson?
BOATSWAIN:
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour;
keep your cabins; you do assist the storm.
GONZALO:
Nay, good, be patient.
BOATSWAIN:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these
roarers for the name of king? To cabin! silence! Trouble
us not.
GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
BOATSWAIN:
None that I more love than myself. You are
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not
hand a rope more. Use your authority; if you cannot, give
thanks you have liv'd so long, and make yourself ready
in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so
hap.-Cheerly, good hearts!-Out of our way, I say.
GONZALO:
I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks
he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging;
make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth
little advantage. If he be not born to be hang'd, our
case is miserable.
BOATSWAIN:
Down with the topmast. Yare, lower, lower!
Bring her to try wi' th' maincourse. A
plague upon this howling! They are louder than the
weather or our office.
Yet again! What do you here? Shall we give o'er, and
drown? Have you a mind to sink?
SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!
BOATSWAIN:
Work you, then.
ANTONIO:
Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker;
we are less afraid to be drown'd than thou art.
GONZALO:
I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched
wench.
BOATSWAIN:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold; set her two courses; off
to sea again; lay her off.
MARINERS:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
BOATSWAIN:
What, must our mouths be cold?
GONZALO:
The King and Prince at prayers!
Let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.
SEBASTIAN:
I am out of patience.
ANTONIO:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
This wide-chopp'd rascal-would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it,
And gape at wid'st to glut him.
We split, we split! Farewell, my wife and children!
Farewell, brother! We split, we split, we split!]
ANTONIO:
Let's all sink wi' th' King.
SEBASTIAN:
Let's take leave of him.
GONZALO:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
an acre of barren ground-long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done, but I would fain die
dry death.
MIRANDA:
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces! O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.
PROSPERO:
Be conected;
No more amazement; tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.
MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!
PROSPERO:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.
MIRANDA:
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
PROSPERO:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So,
Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul-
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink.
Sit down, for thou must now know farther.
MIRANDA:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp'd,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay; not yet.'
PROSPERO:
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst; for then thou wast not
Out three years old.
MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.
PROSPERO:
By what? By any other house, or person?
Of any thing the image, tell me, that
Hath kept with thy remembrance?
MIRANDA:
'Tis far off,
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four, or five, women once, that tended me?
PROSPERO:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou rememb'rest aught, ere thou cam'st here,
How thou cam'st here thou mayst.
MIRANDA:
But that I do not.
PROSPERO:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and
A prince of power.
MIRANDA:
Sir, are not you my father?
PROSPERO:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
And princess no worse issued.
MIRANDA:
O, the heavens!
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?
PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl.
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;
But blessedly holp hither.
MIRANDA:
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.
PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-
I pray thee, mark me that a brother should
Be so perfidious. He, whom next thyself
Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first,
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel, those being all my study-
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-
Dost thou attend me?
MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.
PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who t' advance, and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state
To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
MIRANDA:
O, good sir, I do!
PROSPERO:
I pray thee, mark me.
I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retir'd,
O'er-priz'd all popular rate, in my false brother
Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie-he did believe
He was indeed the Duke; out o' th' substitution,
And executing th' outward face of royalty
With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing-
Dost thou hear?
MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
PROSPERO:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man-my library
Was dukedom large enough-of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates,
So dry he was for sway, wi' th' King of Naples,
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
The dukedom, yet unbow'd-alas, poor Milan!-
To most ignoble stooping.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
PROSPERO:
Mark his condition, and th' event, then tell me
If this might be a brother.
MIRANDA:
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
PROSPERO:
Now the condition:
This King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' th' premises,
Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother. Whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to th' purpose, did Antonio open
The gates of Milan; and, i' th' dead of darkness,
The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.
MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again; it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.
PROSPERO:
Hear a little further,
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines
Which now's upon 's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.
MIRANDA:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench!
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
A mark so bloody on the business; but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark;
Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,
To cry to th' sea, that roar'd to us; to sigh
To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.
MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!
PROSPERO:
O, a cherubin
Thou wast that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burden groan'd; which rais'd in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.
MIRANDA:
How came we ashore?
PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, who being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.
MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever see that man!
PROSPERO:
Now I arise.
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arriv'd; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princess' can, that have more time
For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.
MIRANDA:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?
PROSPERO:
Know thus far forth:
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;
Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dullness,
And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.
Come away, servant; come; I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel. Come.
ARIEL:
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds. To thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.
PROSPERO:
Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flam'd amazement. Sometime I'd divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join Jove's lightning, the precursors
O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.
PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?
ARIEL:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plung'd in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring-then like reeds, not hair-
Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here.'
PROSPERO:
Why, that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
ARIEL:
Close by, my master.
PROSPERO:
But are they, Ariel, safe?
ARIEL:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before; and, as thou bad'st me,
In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.
The King's son have I landed by himself,
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.
PROSPERO:
Of the King's ship,
The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,
And all the rest o' th' fleet?
ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the King's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid;
The mariners all under hatches stowed,
Who, with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet,
Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd,
And his great person perish.
PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd; but there's more work.
What is the time o' th' day?
ARIEL:
Past the mid season.
PROSPERO:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
ARIEL:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd,
Which is not yet perform'd me.
PROSPERO:
How now, moody?
What is't thou canst demand?
ARIEL:
My liberty.
PROSPERO:
Before the time be out? No more!
ARIEL:
I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service,
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, serv'd
Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.
PROSPERO:
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?
ARIEL:
No.
PROSPERO:
Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' th' earth
When it is bak'd with frost.
ARIEL:
I do not, sir.
PROSPERO:
Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?
ARIEL:
No, sir.
PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where was she born?
Speak; tell me.
ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.
PROSPERO:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier
Thou know'st was banish'd; for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
ARIEL:
Ay, sir.
PROSPERO:
This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child,
And here was left by th'sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers,
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died,
And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.
PROSPERO:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
Of ever-angry bears; it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo. It was mine art,
When I arriv'd and heard thee, that made gape
The pine, and let thee out.
ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.
PROSPERO:
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command,
And do my spriting gently.
PROSPERO:
Do so; and after two days
I will discharge thee.
ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? Say what. What shall I do?
PROSPERO:
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea; be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,
And hither come in 't. Go, hence with diligence!
Awake, dear heart, awake; thou hast slept well;
Awake.
MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
PROSPERO:
Shake it off. Come on,
We'll visit Caliban, my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.
MIRANDA:
'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.
PROSPERO:
But as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
That profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! Speak.
CALIBAN:
[ Within]
PROSPERO:
Come forth, I say; there's other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.
ARIEL:
My lord, it shall be done.
PROSPERO:
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
CALIBAN:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! A south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!
PROSPERO:
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.
CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou tak'st from me. When thou cam'st first,
Thou strok'st me and made much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee,
And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile.
Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' th' island.
PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us'd thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodg'd thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.
CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! Would't had been done.
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopl'd else
This isle with Calibans.
MIRANDA:
Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confin'd into this rock, who hadst
Deserv'd more than a prison.
CALIBAN:
You taught me language, and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!
PROSPERO:
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel. And be quick, thou 'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
CALIBAN:
No, pray thee.
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
And make a vassal of him.
PROSPERO:
So, slave; hence!
FERDINAND:
Where should this music be? I' th' air or th'
earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
Some god o' th' island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air; thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
FERDINAND:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
And say what thou seest yond.
MIRANDA:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
PROSPERO:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and but he's something stain'd
With grief, that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
And strays about to find 'em.
MIRANDA:
I might call him
A thing divine; for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
Within two days for this.
FERDINAND:
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my pray'r
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?
MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.
FERDINAND:
My language? Heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.
PROSPERO:
How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
FERDINAND:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The King my father wreck'd.
MIRANDA:
Alack, for mercy!
FERDINAND:
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
They have chang'd eyes. Delicate Ariel,
I'll set thee free for this. A word, good
sir;
I fear you have done yourself some wrong; a word.
MIRANDA:
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first
That e'er I sigh'd for. Pity move my father
To be inclin'd my way!
FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The Queen of Naples.
PROSPERO:
Soft, Sir! one word more.
busines
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. One word more; I
charge thee
That thou attend me; thou dost here usurp
The name thou ow'st not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.
FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.
MIRANDA:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together.
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook mussels, wither'd roots, and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
FERDINAND:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.
MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle, and not fearful.
PROSPERO:
What, I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt. Come from thy ward;
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.
MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father!
PROSPERO:
Hence! Hang not on my garments.
MIRANDA:
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.
PROSPERO:
Silence! One word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an impostor! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!
To th' most of men this is a Caliban,
And they to him are angels.
MIRANDA:
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.
PROSPERO:
Come on; obey.
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
And have no vigour in them.
FERDINAND:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats
To whom I am subdu'd, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! Follow
me.
MIRANDA:
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech; this is unwonted
Which now came from him.
PROSPERO:
[To ARIEL]
As mountain winds; but then exactly do
All points of my command.
ARIEL:
To th' syllable.
PROSPERO:
[To FERDINAND]
Speak not for him.
GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day, some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
ANTONIO:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
SEBASTIAN:
Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by
and by it will strike.
GONZALO:
Sir-
SEBASTIAN:
One-Tell.
GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to th' entertainer-
SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.
GONZALO:
Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken
truer than you purpos'd.
SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
should.
GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord-
ANTONIO:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.
GONZALO:
Well, I have done; but yet-
SEBASTIAN:
He will be talking.
ANTONIO:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
begins to crow?
SEBASTIAN:
The old cock.
ANTONIO:
The cock'rel.
SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?
ANTONIO:
A laughter.
SEBASTIAN:
A match!
ADRIAN:
Though this island seem to be desert-
ANTONIO:
Ha, ha, ha!
SEBASTIAN:
So, you're paid.
ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
SEBASTIAN:
Yet-
ADRIAN:
Yet-
ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.
ADRIAN:
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
temperance.
ANTONIO:
Temperance was a delicate wench.
SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
deliver'd.
ADRIAN:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
SEBASTIAN:
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
ANTONIO:
Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.
ANTONIO:
True; save means to live.
SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.
GONZALO:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
ANTONIO:
The ground indeed is tawny.
SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of green in't.
ANTONIO:
He misses not much.
SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
GONZALO:
But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost
beyond credit-
SEBASTIAN:
As many vouch'd rarities are.
GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd
in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dy'd, than stain'd with salt
water.
ANTONIO:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
not say he lies?
SEBASTIAN:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
GONZALO:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the
King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in
our return.
ADRIAN:
Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
to their queen.
GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.
ANTONIO:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
in? Widow Dido!
SEBASTIAN:
What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?
Good Lord, how you take it!
ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
ADRIAN:
Carthage?
GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.
ANTONIO:
His word is more than the miraculous harp.
SEBASTIAN:
He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
ANTONIO:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
SEBASTIAN:
I think he will carry this island home in his
pocket, and give it his son for an apple.
ANTONIO:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.
GONZALO:
Ay.
ANTONIO:
Why, in good time.
GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of
your daughter, who is now Queen.
ANTONIO:
And the rarest that e'er came there.
SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
GONZALO:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.
ANTONIO:
That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
GONZALO:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there; for, coming thence,
My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?
FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live;
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To th' shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bowed,
As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt
He came alive to land.
ALONSO:
No, no, he's gone.
SEBASTIAN:
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she, at least, is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.
SEBASTIAN:
You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise
By all of us; and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at
Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost your son,
I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have
Moe widows in them of this business' making,
Than we bring men to comfort them;
The fault's your own.
ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
GONZALO:
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,
And time to speak it in; you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.
SEBASTIAN:
Very well.
ANTONIO:
And most chirurgeonly.
GONZALO:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.
SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?
ANTONIO:
Very foul.
GONZALO:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
ANTONIO:
He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
SEBASTIAN:
Or docks, or mallows.
GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?
SEBASTIAN:
Scape being drunk for want of wine.
GONZALO:
I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty-
SEBASTIAN:
Yet he would be king on't.
ANTONIO:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.
GONZALO:
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour. Treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.
SEBASTIAN:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
ANTONIO:
None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
GONZALO:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
T' excel the golden age.
SEBASTIAN:
Save his Majesty!
ANTONIO:
Long live Gonzalo!
GONZALO:
And-do you mark me, sir?
ALONSO:
Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
GONZALO:
I do well believe your Highness; and did it to
minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such
sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh
at nothing.
ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laugh'd at.
GONZALO:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
you; so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.
ANTONIO:
What a blow was there given!
SEBASTIAN:
An it had not fall'n flat-long.
GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would
lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.
SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
ANTONIO:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
GONZALO:
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my
discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am
very heavy?
ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.
ALONSO:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts; I find
They are inclin'd to do so.
SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.
ANTONIO:
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.
ALONSO:
Thank you-wondrous heavy!
SEBASTIAN:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
ANTONIO:
It is the quality o' th' climate.
SEBASTIAN:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself dispos'd to sleep.
ANTONIO:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might! No more!
And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be; th' occasion speaks thee; and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.
SEBASTIAN:
What, art thou waking?
ANTONIO:
Do you not hear me speak?
SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.
ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep-die rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.
SEBASTIAN:
Thou dost snore distinctly;
There's meaning in thy snores.
ANTONIO:
I am more serious than my custom; you
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.
SEBASTIAN:
Well, I am standing water.
ANTONIO:
I'll teach you how to flow.
SEBASTIAN:
Do so: to ebb,
Hereditary sloth instructs me.
ANTONIO:
O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish,
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,
Most often, do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.
SEBASTIAN:
Prithee say on.
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
Which throes thee much to yield.
ANTONIO:
Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded-
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade-the King his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
As he that sleeps here swims.
SEBASTIAN:
I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.
ANTONIO:
O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! No hope that way is
Another way so high a hope, that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?
SEBASTIAN:
He's gone.
ANTONIO:
Then tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?
SEBASTIAN:
Claribel.
ANTONIO:
She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post,
The Man i' th' Moon's too slow, till newborn chins
Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny, to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.
SEBASTIAN:
What stuff is this! How say you?
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
There is some space.
ANTONIO:
A space whose ev'ry cubit
Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say this were death
That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! What a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?
SEBASTIAN:
Methinks I do.
ANTONIO:
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?
SEBASTIAN:
I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.
ANTONIO:
True.
And look how well my garments sit upon me,
Much feater than before. My brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
SEBASTIAN:
But, for your conscience-
ANTONIO:
Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
This deity in my bosom; twenty consciences
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like-that's dead;
Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.
SEBASTIAN:
Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the King shall love thee.
ANTONIO:
Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.
SEBASTIAN:
O, but one word.
ARIEL:
My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth-
For else his project dies-to keep them living.
While you here do snoring lie,
Open-ey'd conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware.
Awake, awake!
ANTONIO:
Then let us both be sudden.
GONZALO:
Now, good angels
Preserve the King!
ALONSO:
Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
GONZALO:
What's the matter?
SEBASTIAN:
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls, or rather lions; did't not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
ALONSO:
I heard nothing.
ANTONIO:
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.
ALONSO:
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
GONZALO:
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me;
I shak'd you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn-there was a noise,
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons.
ALONSO:
Lead off this ground; and let's make further
search
For my poor son.
GONZALO:
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' th' island.
ALONSO:
Lead away.
ARIEL:
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done;
So, King, go safely on to seek thy son.
CALIBAN:
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.
TRINCULO:
Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any
weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it
sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one,
looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If
it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to
hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or
alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A
strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and
had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but
would give a piece of silver. There would this monster
make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when
they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they
will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a
man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now
let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
thunderbolt. Alas, the storm is come again! My
best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no
other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs
of the storm be past.
STEPHANO:
I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore-
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral;
well, here's my comfort.
The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,
The gunner, and his mate,
Lov'd Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,
But none of us car'd for Kate;
For she had a tongue with a tang,
Would cry to a sailor 'Go hang!'
She lov'd not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch.
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
This is a scurvy tune too; but here's my comfort.
CALIBAN:
Do not torment me. O!
STEPHANO:
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind? Ha! I
have not scap'd drowning to be afeard now of your four
legs; for it hath been said: As proper a man as ever
went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it
shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at
nostrils.
CALIBAN:
The spirit torments me. O!
STEPHANO:
This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him, and
keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he's a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's
leather.
CALIBAN:
Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood
home faster.
STEPHANO:
He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle; if he have never
drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If
I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take
too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him,
and that soundly.
CALIBAN:
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
I know it by thy trembling; now Prosper works upon thee.
STEPHANO:
Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
that which will give language to you, cat. Open your
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and
that soundly; you cannot tell who's your friend. Open
your chaps again.
TRINCULO:
I should know that voice; it should be-but he is
drown'd; and these are devils. O, defend me!
STEPHANO:
Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!
His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and
to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover
him, I will help his ague. Come-Amen! I will pour some
in thy other mouth.
TRINCULO:
Stephano!
STEPHANO:
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!
This is a devil, and no monster; I will leave him; I
have no long spoon.
TRINCULO:
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and
speak to me; for I am Trinculo-be not afeard-thy good
friend Trinculo.
STEPHANO:
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull
the by the lesser legs; if any be Trinculo's legs, these
are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How cam'st thou
to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent
Trinculos?
TRINCULO:
I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke.
But art thou not drown'd, Stephano? I hope now thou are
not drown'd. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the
dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm. And
art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans
scap'd!
STEPHANO:
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
constant.
CALIBAN:
[Aside]
sprites.
That's a brave god, and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.
STEPHANO:
How didst thou scape? How cam'st thou hither?
Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither-I escap'd
upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o'erboard-
by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree, with
mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.
CALIBAN:
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
STEPHANO:
Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.
TRINCULO:
Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like
a duck, I'll be sworn.
STEPHANO:
[Passing the bottle]
thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a
goose.
TRINCULO:
O Stephano, hast any more of this?
STEPHANO:
The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by
th' seaside, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
How does thine ague?
CALIBAN:
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
STEPHANO:
Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man
i' th' Moon, when time was.
CALIBAN:
I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My
mistress show'd me thee, and thy dog and thy bush.
STEPHANO:
Come, swear to that; kiss the book. I will
furnish it anon with new contents. Swear.
TRINCULO:
By this good light, this is a very shallow
monster!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The Man i' th'
Moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well drawn,
monster, in good sooth!
CALIBAN:
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
and will kiss thy foot. I prithee be my god.
TRINCULO:
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
monster! When's god's asleep he'll rob his bottle.
CALIBAN:
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy
subject.
STEPHANO:
Come on, then; down, and swear.
TRINCULO:
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-
headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in
my heart to beat him-
STEPHANO:
Come, kiss.
TRINCULO:
But that the poor monster's in drink. An
abominable monster!
CALIBAN:
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee
berries;
I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.
TRINCULO:
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of
a poor drunkard!
CALIBAN:
I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
STEPHANO:
I prithee now, lead the way without any more
talking. Trinculo, the King and all our company else
being drown'd, we will inherit here. Here, bear my bottle.
Fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again.
CALIBAN:
[Sings drunkenly]
farewell!
TRINCULO:
A howling monster; a drunken monster!
CALIBAN:
No more dams I'll make for fish;
Nor fetch in firing
At requiring,
Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish.
'Ban 'Ban, Ca-Caliban,
Has a new master-Get a new man.
Freedom, high-day! high-day, freedom! freedom, high-
day, freedom!
STEPHANO:
O brave monster! Lead the way.
FERDINAND:
There be some sports are painful, and their
labour
Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed;
And he's compos'd of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget;
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy, least when I do it.
MIRANDA:
Alas, now; pray you,
Work not so hard; I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile.
Pray, set it down and rest you; when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours.
FERDINAND:
O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.
MIRANDA:
If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while; pray give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile.
FERDINAND:
No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.
MIRANDA:
It would become me
As well as it does you; and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
This visitation shows it.
MIRANDA:
You look wearily.
FERDINAND:
No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you,
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,
What is your name?
MIRANDA:
Miranda-O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so!
FERDINAND:
Admir'd Miranda!
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have ey'd with best regard; and many a time
Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues
Have I lik'd several women, never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,
And put it to the foil; but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!
MIRANDA:
I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you;
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
I therein do forget.
FERDINAND:
I am, in my condition,
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
I would not so!-and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service; there resides
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man.
MIRANDA:
Do you love me?
FERDINAND:
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world,
Do love, prize, honour you.
MIRANDA:
I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between 'em!
FERDINAND:
Wherefore weep you?
MIRANDA:
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me;
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
Whether you will or no.
FERDINAND:
My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.
MIRANDA:
My husband, then?
FERDINAND:
Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom. Here's my hand.
MIRANDA:
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
Till half an hour hence.
FERDINAND:
A thousand thousand!
PROSPERO:
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surpris'd withal; but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book;
For yet ere supper time must I perform
Much business appertaining.
STEPHANO:
Tell not me-when the butt is out we will drink
water, not a drop before; therefore bear up, and board
'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
TRINCULO:
Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of
them; if th' other two be brain'd like us, the state
totters.
STEPHANO:
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy
eyes are almost set in thy head.
TRINCULO:
Where should they be set else? He were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
STEPHANO:
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in
sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere
I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues, off
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
monster, or my standard.
TRINCULO:
Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
STEPHANO:
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
TRINCULO:
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs, and
yet say nothing neither.
STEPHANO:
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest
a good moon-calf.
CALIBAN:
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.
TRINCULO:
Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh'd fish, thou,
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack
as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but
half fish and half a monster?
CALIBAN:
Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my
lord?
TRINCULO:
'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such
a natural!
CALIBAN:
Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head; if
you prove a mutineer-the next tree! The poor monster's
my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.
CALIBAN:
I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas'd to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
STEPHANO:
Marry will I; kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
and so shall Trinculo.
CALIBAN:
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant,
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the
island.
ARIEL:
Thou liest.
CALIBAN:
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou;
I would my valiant master would destroy thee.
I do not lie.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
TRINCULO:
Why, I said nothing.
STEPHANO:
Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
CALIBAN:
I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
From me he got it. If thy greatness will
Revenge it on him-for I know thou dar'st,
But this thing dare not-
STEPHANO:
That's most certain.
CALIBAN:
Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.
STEPHANO:
How now shall this be compass'd? Canst thou
bring me to the party?
CALIBAN:
Yea, yea, my lord; I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
ARIEL:
Thou liest; thou canst not.
CALIBAN:
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
And take his bottle from him. When that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.
STEPHANO:
Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt
the monster one word further and, by this hand, I'll turn
my mercy out o' doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.
TRINCULO:
Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
off.
STEPHANO:
Didst thou not say he lied?
ARIEL:
Thou liest.
STEPHANO:
Do I so? Take thou that. As you like
this, give me the lie another time.
TRINCULO:
I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and
hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! This can sack and
drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil
take your fingers!
CALIBAN:
Ha, ha, ha!
STEPHANO:
Now, forward with your tale.-Prithee stand
further off.
CALIBAN:
Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat
him too.
STEPHANO:
Stand farther. Come, proceed.
CALIBAN:
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him
I' th' afternoon to sleep; there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seiz'd his books; or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command; they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils-for so he calls them-
Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.
STEPHANO:
Is it so brave a lass?
CALIBAN:
Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,
And bring thee forth brave brood.
STEPHANO:
Monster, I will kill this man; his daughter and I
will be King and Queen-save our Graces!-and Trinculo
and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,
Trinculo?
TRINCULO:
Excellent.
STEPHANO:
Give me thy hand; I am sorry I beat thee; but
while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy head.
CALIBAN:
Within this half hour will he be asleep.
Wilt thou destroy him then?
STEPHANO:
Ay, on mine honour.
ARIEL:
This will I tell my master.
CALIBAN:
Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.
Let us be jocund; will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?
STEPHANO:
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Flout 'em and scout 'em,
And scout 'em and flout 'em;
Thought is free.
CALIBAN:
That's not the tune.
STEPHANO:
What is this same?
TRINCULO:
This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the
picture of Nobody.
STEPHANO:
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy
likeness; if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
TRINCULO:
O, forgive me my sins!
STEPHANO:
He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy
upon us!
CALIBAN:
Art thou afeard?
STEPHANO:
No, monster, not I.
CALIBAN:
Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,
That, if I then had wak'd after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that, when I wak'd,
I cried to dream again.
STEPHANO:
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I
shall have my music for nothing.
CALIBAN:
When Prospero is destroy'd.
STEPHANO:
That shall be by and by; I remember the story.
TRINCULO:
The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
after do our work.
STEPHANO:
Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
this taborer; he lays it on.
TRINCULO:
Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
GONZALO:
By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
My old bones ache. Here's a maze trod, indeed,
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.
ALONSO:
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach'd with weariness
To th' dulling of my spirits; sit down and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
No longer for my flatterer; he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
ANTONIO:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]
so out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose
That you resolv'd t' effect.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside to ANTONIO]
Will we take throughly.
ANTONIO:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside to ANTONIO]
ALONSO:
What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
GONZALO:
Marvellous sweet music!
ALONSO:
Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
SEBASTIAN:
A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
At this hour reigning-there.
ANTONIO:
I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true; travellers ne'er did lie,
Though fools at home condemn 'em.
GONZALO:
If in Naples
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders,
For certes these are people of the island,
Who though they are of monstrous shape yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
Are worse than devils.
ALONSO:
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing,
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
FRANCISCO:
They vanish'd strangely.
SEBASTIAN:
No matter, since
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
Will't please you taste of what is here?
ALONSO:
Not I.
GONZALO:
Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Who would believe that there were mountaineers,
Dewlapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.
ALONSO:
I will stand to, and feed,
Although my last; no matter, since I feel
The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,
Stand to, and do as we.
ARIEL:
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caus'd to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit-you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.
You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate; the elements
Of whom your swords are temper'd may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that's in my plume; my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted. But remember-
For that's my business to you-that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Expos'd unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him, and his innocent child; for which foul deed
The pow'rs, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me
Ling'ring perdition, worse than any death
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from-
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads-is nothing but heart's sorrow,
And a clear life ensuing.
PROSPERO:
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say; so, with good life
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,
And these mine enemies are all knit up
In their distractions. They now are in my pow'r;
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
And his and mine lov'd darling.
GONZALO:
I' th' name of something holy, sir, why stand you
In this strange stare?
ALONSO:
O, it is monstrous, monstrous!
Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc'd
The name of Prosper; it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded; and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded,
And with him there lie mudded.
SEBASTIAN:
But one fiend at a time,
I'll fight their legions o'er.
ANTONIO:
I'll be thy second.
GONZALO:
All three of them are desperate; their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,
Now gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you,
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.
ADRIAN:
Follow, I pray you.
PROSPERO:
If I have too austerely punish'd you,
Your compensation makes amends; for
Have given you here a third of mine own life,
Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test; here, afore heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand!
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,
And make it halt behind her.
FERDINAND:
I do believe it
Against an oracle.
PROSPERO:
Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
Wort'hily purchas'd, take my daughter. But
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minist'red,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
Sour-ey'd disdain, and discord, shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
FERDINAND:
As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust, to take away
The edge of that day's celebration,
When I shall think or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd
Or Night kept chain'd below.
PROSPERO:
Fairly spoke.
Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
ARIEL:
What would my potent master? Here I am.
PROSPERO:
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
O'er whom I give thee pow'r, here to this place.
Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art; it is my promise,
And they expect it from me.
ARIEL:
Presently?
PROSPERO:
Ay, with a twink.
ARIEL:
Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
And breathe twice, and cry 'so, so,'
Each one, tripping on his toe,
Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master? No?
PROSPERO:
Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.
ARIEL:
Well! I conceive.
PROSPERO:
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw
To th' fire i' th' blood. Be more abstemious,
Or else good night your vow!
FERDINAND:
I warrant you, sir,
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver.
PROSPERO:
Well!
Now come, my Ariel, bring a corollary,
Rather than want a spirit; appear, and pertly.
No tongue! All eyes! Be silent.
IRIS:
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,
Where thou thyself dost air-the Queen o' th' sky,
Whose wat'ry arch and messenger am I,
Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
CERES:
Hail, many-coloured messenger, that ne'er
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flow'rs
Diffusest honey drops, refreshing show'rs;
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
Rich scarf to my proud earth-why hath thy Queen
Summon'd me hither to this short-grass'd green?
IRIS:
A contract of true love to celebrate,
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers.
CERES:
Tell me, heavenly bow,
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
I have forsworn.
IRIS:
Of her society
Be not afraid. I met her Deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
Whose vows are that no bed-rite shall be paid
Till Hymen's torch be lighted; but in vain.
Mars's hot minion is return'd again;
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,
And be a boy right out.
CERES:
Highest Queen of State,
Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
JUNO:
How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
And honour'd in their issue.
JUNO:
Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
Long continuance, and increasing,
Hourly joys be still upon you!
Juno sings her blessings on you.
CERES:
Earth's increase, foison plenty,
Barns and gamers never empty;
Vines with clust'ring bunches growing,
Plants with goodly burden bowing;
Spring come to you at the farthest,
In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you,
Ceres' blessing so is on you.
FERDINAND:
This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?
PROSPERO:
Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines call'd to enact
My present fancies.
FERDINAND:
Let me live here ever;
So rare a wond'red father and a wise
Makes this place Paradise.
PROSPERO:
Sweet now, silence;
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.
There's something else to do; hush, and be mute,
Or else our spell is marr'd.
IRIS:
You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the wind'ring brooks,
With your sedg'd crowns and ever harmless looks,
Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land
Answer your summons; Juno does command.
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
A contract of true love; be not too late.
You sun-burnt sicklemen, of August weary,
Come hither from the furrow, and be merry;
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.
PROSPERO:
[Aside]
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life; the minute of their plot
Is almost come. Well done; avoid; no
more!
FERDINAND:
This is strange; your father's in some passion
That works him strongly.
MIRANDA:
Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
PROSPERO:
You do look, my son, in a mov'd sort,
As if you were dismay'd; be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
Are melted into air, into thin air;
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on; and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled;
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity.
If you be pleas'd, retire into my cell
And there repose; a turn or two I'll walk
To still my beating mind.
PROSPERO:
Come, with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel; come.
ARIEL:
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
PROSPERO:
Spirit,
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
ARIEL:
Ay, my commander. When I presented 'Ceres.'
I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear'd
Lest I might anger thee.
PROSPERO:
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
ARIEL:
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
So full of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,
At which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears,
Advanc'd their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music; so I charm'd their cars,
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,
Which ent'red their frail shins. At last I left them
I' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake
O'erstunk their feet.
PROSPERO:
This was well done, my bird.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither
For stale to catch these thieves.
ARIEL:
I go, I go.
PROSPERO:
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.
Come, hang them on this line.
CALIBAN:
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.
STEPHANO:
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless
fairy, has done little better than play'd the Jack with us.
TRINCULO:
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss at which my
nose is in great indignation.
STEPHANO:
So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should
take a displeasure against you, look you-
TRINCULO:
Thou wert but a lost monster.
CALIBAN:
Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.
TRINCULO:
Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
STEPHANO:
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
that, monster, but an infinite loss.
TRINCULO:
That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is
your harmless fairy, monster.
STEPHANO:
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er
ears for my labour.
CALIBAN:
Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
This is the mouth o' th' cell; no noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.
STEPHANO:
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
thoughts.
TRINCULO:
O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
CALIBAN:
Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
TRINCULO:
O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a
frippery. O King Stephano!
STEPHANO:
Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll
have that gown.
TRINCULO:
Thy Grace shall have it.
CALIBAN:
The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let 't alone,
And do the murder first. If he awake,
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches;
Make us strange stuff.
STEPHANO:
Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not
this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line; now,
jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald
jerkin.
TRINCULO:
Do, do. We steal by line and level, an't like
your Grace.
STEPHANO:
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment
for't. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of
this country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
pass of pate; there's another garmet for't.
TRINCULO:
Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
and away with the rest.
CALIBAN:
I will have none on't. We shall lose our time,
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villainous low.
STEPHANO:
Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out
of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.
TRINCULO:
And this.
STEPHANO:
Ay, and this.
PROSPERO:
Hey, Mountain, hey!
ARIEL:
Silver! there it goes, Silver!
PROSPERO:
Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
Than pard or cat o' mountain.
ARIEL:
Hark, they roar.
PROSPERO:
Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom; for a little
Follow, and do me service.
PROSPERO:
Now does my project gather to a head;
My charms crack not, my spirits obey; and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
ARIEL:
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease.
PROSPERO:
I did say so,
When first I rais'd the tempest. Say, my spirit,
How fares the King and 's followers?
ARIEL:
Confin'd together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge;
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
They cannot budge till your release. The King,
His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brim full of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Him you term'd, sir, 'the good old lord, Gonzalo';
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them your affections
Would become tender.
PROSPERO:
Dost thou think so, spirit?
ARIEL:
Mine would, sir, were I human.
PROSPERO:
And mine shall.
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art?
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick,
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
Do I take part; the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance; they being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel;
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
And they shall be themselves.
ARIEL:
I'll fetch them, sir.
PROSPERO:
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and
groves;
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-
Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak
With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory
Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up
The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd
Some heavenly music-which even now I do-
To work mine end upon their senses that
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
I'll drown my book.
A solemn air, and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
For you are spell-stopp'd.
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
And as the morning steals upon the night,
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-
Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;
I will discase me, and myself present
As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit
Thou shalt ere long be free.
Where the bee sucks, there suck I;
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
PROSPERO:
Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;
But yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.
To the King's ship, invisible as thou art;
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
Being awake, enforce them to this place;
And presently, I prithee.
ARIEL:
I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat.
GONZALO:
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement,
Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country!
PROSPERO:
Behold, Sir King,
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome.
ALONSO:
Whe'er thou be'st he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know. Thy pulse
Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which,
I fear, a madness held me. This must crave-
An if this be at all-a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?
PROSPERO:
First, noble friend,
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measur'd or confin'd.
GONZALO:
Whether this be
Or be not, I'll not swear.
PROSPERO:
You do yet taste
Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you,
And justify you traitors; at this time
I will tell no tales.
SEBASTIAN:
[Aside]
PROSPERO:
No.
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault-all of them; and require
My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know
Thou must restore.
ALONSO:
If thou beest Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;
How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost-
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-
My dear son Ferdinand.
PROSPERO:
I am woe for't, sir.
ALONSO:
Irreparable is the loss; and patience
Says it is past her cure.
PROSPERO:
I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
And rest myself content.
ALONSO:
You the like loss!
PROSPERO:
As great to me as late; and, supportable
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter.
ALONSO:
A daughter!
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
PROSPERO:
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason, and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Are natural breath; but, howsoe'er you have
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
That I am Prospero, and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely
Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
Not a relation for a breakfast, nor
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
This cell's my court; here have I few attendants,
And subjects none abroad; pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again,
I will requite you with as good a thing;
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
As much as me my dukedom.
MIRANDA:
Sweet lord, you play me false.
FERDINAND:
No, my dearest love,
I would not for the world.
MIRANDA:
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
And I would call it fair play.
ALONSO:
If this prove
A vision of the island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose.
SEBASTIAN:
A most high miracle!
FERDINAND:
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
I have curs'd them without cause.
ALONSO:
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.
MIRANDA:
O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world
That has such people in't!
PROSPERO:
'Tis new to thee.
ALONSO:
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours;
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
And brought us thus together?
FERDINAND:
Sir, she is mortal;
But by immortal Providence she's mine.
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
Of whom so often I have heard renown
But never saw before; of whom I have
Receiv'd a second life; and second father
This lady makes him to me.
ALONSO:
I am hers.
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!
PROSPERO:
There, sir, stop;
Let us not burden our remembrances with
A heaviness that's gone.
GONZALO:
I have inly wept,
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown;
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Which brought us hither.
ALONSO:
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
GONZALO:
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
Should become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis;
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.
ALONSO:
[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]
hands.
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy.
GONZALO:
Be it so. Amen!
O look, sir; look, sir! Here is more of us!
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
BOATSWAIN:
The best news is that we have safely found
Our King and company; the next, our ship-
Which but three glasses since we gave out split-
Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg'd, as when
We first put out to sea.
ARIEL:
[Aside to PROSPERO]
Have I done since I went.
PROSPERO:
[Aside to ARIEL]
ALONSO:
These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
BOATSWAIN:
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
And-how, we know not-all clapp'd under hatches;
Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
And moe diversity of sounds, all horrible,
We were awak'd; straightway at liberty;
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
Cap'ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,
Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
And were brought moping hither.
ARIEL:
[Aside to PROSPERO]
PROSPERO:
[Aside to ARIEL]
shalt be free.
ALONSO:
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of. Some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.
PROSPERO:
Sir, my liege,
Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
And think of each thing well. Come
hither, spirit;
Set Caliban and his companions free;
Untie the spell. How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not.
STEPHANO:
Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man
take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Coragio,
bully-monster, coragio!
TRINCULO:
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
here's a goodly sight.
CALIBAN:
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.
SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy'em?
ANTONIO:
Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.
PROSPERO:
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave-
His mother was a witch, and one so strong
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
And deal in her command without her power.
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil-
For he's a bastard one-had plotted with them
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
Acknowledge mine.
CALIBAN:
I shall be pinch'd to death.
ALONSO:
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
SEBASTIAN:
He is drunk now; where had he wine?
ALONSO:
And Trinculo is reeling ripe; where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How cam'st thou in this pickle?
TRINCULO:
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you
last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones. I
shall not fear fly-blowing.
SEBASTIAN:
Why, how now, Stephano!
STEPHANO:
O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a
cramp.
PROSPERO:
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?
STEPHANO:
I should have been a sore one, then.
ALONSO:
[Pointing to CALIBAN]
as e'er I look'd on.
PROSPERO:
He is as disproportioned in his manners
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
Take with you your companions; as you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
CALIBAN:
Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter,
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Was I to take this drunkard for a god,
And worship this dull fool!
PROSPERO:
Go to; away!
ALONSO:
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
SEBASTIAN:
Or stole it, rather.
PROSPERO:
Sir, I invite your Highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away-the story of my life,
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle. And in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-belov'd solemnized,
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
Every third thought shall be my grave.
ALONSO:
I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.
PROSPERO:
I'll deliver all;
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off. My Ariel,
That is thy charge. Then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well!-Please you, draw near.
POET:
Good day, sir.
PAINTER:
I am glad y'are well.
POET:
I have not seen you long; how goes the world?
PAINTER:
It wears, sir, as it grows.
POET:
Ay, that's well known.
But what particular rarity? What strange,
Which manifold record not matches? See,
Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power
Hath conjur'd to attend! I know the merchant.
PAINTER:
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
MERCHANT:
O, 'tis a worthy lord!
JEWELLER:
Nay, that's most fix'd.
MERCHANT:
A most incomparable man; breath'd, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness.
He passes.
JEWELLER:
I have a jewel here-
MERCHANT:
O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?
JEWELLER:
If he will touch the estimate. But for that-
POET:
When we for recompense have prais'd the vile,
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good.
MERCHANT:
[Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.
JEWELLER:
And rich. Here is a water, look ye.
PAINTER:
You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
To the great lord.
POET:
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
From whence 'tis nourish'd. The fire i' th' flint
Shows not till it be struck: our gentle flame
Provokes itself, and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
PAINTER:
A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
POET:
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let's see your piece.
PAINTER:
'Tis a good piece.
POET:
So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.
PAINTER:
Indifferent.
POET:
Admirable. How this grace
Speaks his own standing! What a mental power
This eye shoots forth! How big imagination
Moves in this lip! To th' dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret.
PAINTER:
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is't good?
POET:
I will say of it
It tutors nature. Artificial strife
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
PAINTER:
How this lord is followed!
POET:
The senators of Athens- happy man!
PAINTER:
Look, moe!
POET:
You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
I have in this rough work shap'd out a man
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment. My free drift
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
In a wide sea of tax. No levell'd malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold,
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Leaving no tract behind.
PAINTER:
How shall I understand you?
POET:
I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions, how all minds-
As well of glib and slipp'ry creatures as
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself; even he drops down
The knee before him, and returns in peace
Most rich in Timon's nod.
PAINTER:
I saw them speak together.
POET:
Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd. The base o' th' mount
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states. Amongst them all
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.
PAINTER:
'Tis conceiv'd to scope.
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
Bowing his head against the steepy mount
To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
In our condition.
POET:
Nay, sir, but hear me on.
All those which were his fellows but of late-
Some better than his value- on the moment
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Drink the free air.
PAINTER:
Ay, marry, what of these?
POET:
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Not one accompanying his declining foot.
PAINTER:
'Tis common.
A thousand moral paintings I can show
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head.
TIMON:
Imprison'd is he, say you?
MESSENGER:
Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt;
His means most short, his creditors most strait.
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing,
Periods his comfort.
TIMON:
Noble Ventidius! Well.
I am not of that feather to shake of
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
Which he shall have. I'll pay the debt, and free him.
MESSENGER:
Your lordship ever binds him.
TIMON:
Commend me to him; I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchis'd, bid him come to me.
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
But to support him after. Fare you well.
MESSENGER:
All happiness to your honour!
OLD ATHENIAN:
Lord Timon, hear me speak.
TIMON:
Freely, good father.
OLD ATHENIAN:
Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.
TIMON:
I have so; what of him?
OLD ATHENIAN:
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
TIMON:
Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
LUCILIUS:
Here, at your lordship's service.
OLD ATHENIAN:
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift,
And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
Than one which holds a trencher.
TIMON:
Well; what further?
OLD ATHENIAN:
One only daughter have I, no kin else,
On whom I may confer what I have got.
The maid is fair, o' th' youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love; I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Myself have spoke in vain.
TIMON:
The man is honest.
OLD ATHENIAN:
Therefore he will be, Timon.
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.
TIMON:
Does she love him?
OLD ATHENIAN:
She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.
TIMON:
Love you the maid?
LUCILIUS:
Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
OLD ATHENIAN:
If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all.
TIMON:
How shall she be endow'd,
If she be mated with an equal husband?
OLD ATHENIAN:
Three talents on the present; in future, all.
TIMON:
This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long;.
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.
OLD ATHENIAN:
Most noble lord,
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
TIMON:
My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
LUCILIUS:
Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may
That state or fortune fall into my keeping
Which is not owed to you!
POET:
[Presenting his poem] Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your
lordship!
TIMON:
I thank you; you shall hear from me anon;
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
PAINTER:
A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept.
TIMON:
Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside; these pencill'd figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work,
And you shall find I like it; wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.
PAINTER:
The gods preserve ye!
TIMON:
Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand;
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Hath suffered under praise.
JEWELLER:
What, my lord! Dispraise?
TIMON:
A mere satiety of commendations;
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
It would unclew me quite.
JEWELLER:
My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give; but you well know
Things of like value, differing in the owners,
Are prized by their masters. Believe't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
TIMON:
Well mock'd.
MERCHANT:
No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.
TIMON:
Look who comes here; will you be chid?
JEWELLER:
We'll bear, with your lordship.
MERCHANT:
He'll spare none.
TIMON:
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
APEMANTUS:
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
TIMON:
Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.
APEMANTUS:
Are they not Athenians?
TIMON:
Yes.
APEMANTUS:
Then I repent not.
JEWELLER:
You know me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
TIMON:
Thou art proud, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS:
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
TIMON:
Whither art going?
APEMANTUS:
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
TIMON:
That's a deed thou't die for.
APEMANTUS:
Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.
TIMON:
How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
The best, for the innocence.
TIMON:
Wrought he not well that painted it?
APEMANTUS:
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's
but a filthy piece of work.
PAINTER:
Y'are a dog.
APEMANTUS:
Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?
TIMON:
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
No; I eat not lords.
TIMON:
An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.
APEMANTUS:
O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
TIMON:
That's a lascivious apprehension.
APEMANTUS:
So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.
TIMON:
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man
a doit.
TIMON:
What dost thou think 'tis worth?
APEMANTUS:
Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
POET:
How now, philosopher!
APEMANTUS:
Thou liest.
POET:
Art not one?
APEMANTUS:
Yes.
POET:
Then I lie not.
APEMANTUS:
Art not a poet?
POET:
Yes.
APEMANTUS:
Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast
feign'd him a worthy fellow.
POET:
That's not feign'd- he is so.
APEMANTUS:
Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
labour. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o' th' flatterer.
Heavens, that I were a lord!
TIMON:
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.
TIMON:
What, thyself?
APEMANTUS:
Ay.
TIMON:
Wherefore?
APEMANTUS:
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.- Art not thou a
merchant?
MERCHANT:
Ay, Apemantus.
APEMANTUS:
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
MERCHANT:
If traffic do it, the gods do it.
APEMANTUS:
Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!
TIMON:
What trumpet's that?
MESSENGER:
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
All of companionship.
TIMON:
Pray entertain them; give them guide to us.
You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you. When dinner's done
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Most welcome, sir!
APEMANTUS:
So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves,
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Into baboon and monkey.
ALCIBIADES:
Sir, you have sav'd my longing, and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight.
TIMON:
Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart we'll share a bounteous time
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
FIRST LORD:
What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Time to be honest.
FIRST LORD:
That time serves still.
APEMANTUS:
The more accursed thou that still omit'st it.
SECOND LORD:
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
APEMANTUS:
Ay; to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
SECOND LORD:
Fare thee well, fare thee well.
APEMANTUS:
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
SECOND LORD:
Why, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give
thee none.
FIRST LORD:
Hang thyself.
APEMANTUS:
No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests
to thy friend.
SECOND LORD:
Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.
APEMANTUS:
I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' th' ass.
FIRST LORD:
He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? He outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
SECOND LORD:
He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward; no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.
FIRST LORD:
The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.
SECOND LORD:
Long may he live in fortunes! shall we in?
FIRST LORD:
I'll keep you company.
VENTIDIUS:
Most honoured Timon,
It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age,
And call him to long peace.
He is gone happy, and has left me rich.
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
I deriv'd liberty.
TIMON:
O, by no means,
Honest Ventidius! You mistake my love;
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives.
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them: faults that are rich are fair.
VENTIDIUS:
A noble spirit!
TIMON:
Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devis'd at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
But where there is true friendship there needs none.
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me.
FIRST LORD:
My lord, we always have confess'd it.
APEMANTUS:
Ho, ho, confess'd it! Hang'd it, have you not?
TIMON:
O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
APEMANTUS:
No;
You shall not make me welcome.
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
TIMON:
Fie, th'art a churl; ye have got a humour there
Does not become a man; 'tis much to blame.
They say, my lords, Ira furor brevis est; but yond man is ever
angry. Go, let him have a table by himself; for he does neither
affect company nor is he fit for't indeed.
APEMANTUS:
Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.
I come to observe; I give thee warning on't.
TIMON:
I take no heed of thee. Th'art an Athenian, therefore
welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make
thee silent.
APEMANTUS:
I scorn thy meat; 't'would choke me, for I should ne'er
flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of men eats Timon, and he
sees 'em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one
man's blood; and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.
Methinks they should invite them without knives:
Good for their meat and safer for their lives.
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits next him now,
parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided
draught, is the readiest man to kill him. 'T has been proved. If
I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals.
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
TIMON:
My lord, in heart! and let the health go round.
SECOND LORD:
Let it flow this way, my good lord.
APEMANTUS:
Flow this way! A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well.
Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.
Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner, honest water, which
ne'er left man i' th' mire.
This and my food are equals; there's no odds.'
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
TIMON:
Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
ALCIBIADES:
My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
TIMON:
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of
friends.
ALCIBIADES:
So they were bleeding new, my lord, there's no meat
like 'em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
APEMANTUS:
Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that
then thou mightst kill 'em, and bid me to 'em.
FIRST LORD:
Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of
our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
TIMON:
O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have
provided that I shall have much help from you. How had you been
my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from
thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own
behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what
need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em?
They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne'er
have use for 'em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung
up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have
often wish'd myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call
our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious
comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one
another's fortunes! O, joy's e'en made away ere't can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their
faults, I drink to you.
APEMANTUS:
Thou weep'st to make them drink, Timon.
SECOND LORD:
Joy had the like conception in our eyes,
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
APEMANTUS:
Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
THIRD LORD:
I promise you, my lord, you mov'd me much.
APEMANTUS:
Much!
TIMON:
What means that trump?
How now?
SERVANT:
Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most
desirous of admittance.
TIMON:
Ladies! What are their wills?
SERVANT:
There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears
that office to signify their pleasures.
TIMON:
I pray let them be admitted.
CUPID:
Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
That of his bounties taste! The five best Senses
Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom. Th' Ear,
Taste, Touch, Smell, pleas'd from thy table rise;
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
TIMON:
They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance.
Music, make their welcome.
FIRST LORD:
You see, my lord, how ample y'are belov'd.
APEMANTUS:
Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
They dance? They are mad women.
Like madness is the glory of this life,
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again
With poisonous spite and envy.
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
Of their friends' gift?
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me. 'T has been done:
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
TIMON:
You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
You have added worth unto't and lustre,
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
I am to thank you for't.
FIRST LADY:
My lord, you take us even at the best.
APEMANTUS:
Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold
taking, I doubt me.
TIMON:
Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you;
Please you to dispose yourselves.
ALL LADIES:
Most thankfully, my lord.
TIMON:
Flavius!
FLAVIUS:
My lord?
TIMON:
The little casket bring me hither.
FLAVIUS:
Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
There is no crossing him in's humour,
Else I should tell him- well i' faith, I should-
When all's spent, he'd be cross'd then, an he could.
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
FIRST LORD:
Where be our men?
SERVANT:
Here, my lord, in readiness.
SECOND LORD:
Our horses!
TIMON:
O my friends,
I have one word to say to you. Look you, my good lord,
I must entreat you honour me so much
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
Kind my lord.
FIRST LORD:
I am so far already in your gifts-
ALL:
So are we all.
SERVANT:
My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate newly
alighted and come to visit you.
TIMON:
They are fairly welcome.
FLAVIUS:
I beseech your honour, vouchsafe me a word; it does
concern you near.
TIMON:
Near! Why then, another time I'll hear thee. I prithee let's
be provided to show them entertainment.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside] I scarce know how.
SECOND SERVANT:
May it please vour honour, Lord Lucius, out of his
free love, hath presented to you four milk-white horses, trapp'd
in silver.
TIMON:
I shall accept them fairly. Let the presents
Be worthily entertain'd.
How now! What news?
THIRD SERVANT:
Please you, my lord, that honourable gentleman, Lord
Lucullus, entreats your company to-morrow to hunt with him and
has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds.
TIMON:
I'll hunt with him; and let them be receiv'd,
Not without fair reward.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside] What will this come to?
He commands us to provide and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer;
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good.
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For ev'ry word. He is so kind that he now
Pays interest for't; his land's put to their books.
Well, would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forc'd out!
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
I bleed inwardly for my lord.
TIMON:
You do yourselves much wrong;
You bate too much of your own merits.
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
SECOND LORD:
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
THIRD LORD:
O, he's the very soul of bounty!
TIMON:
And now I remember, my lord, you gave good words the other
day of a bay courser I rode on. 'Tis yours because you lik'd it.
THIRD LORD:
O, I beseech you pardon me, my lord, in that.
TIMON:
You may take my word, my lord: I know no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect.
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own.
I'll tell you true; I'll call to you.
ALL LORDS:
O, none so welcome!
TIMON:
I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart 'tis not enough to give;
Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich.
It comes in charity to thee; for all thy living
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitch'd field.
ALCIBIADES:
Ay, defil'd land, my lord.
FIRST LORD:
We are so virtuously bound-
TIMON:
And so am I to you.
SECOND LORD:
So infinitely endear'd-
TIMON:
All to you. Lights, more lights!
FIRST LORD:
The best of happiness, honour, and fortunes, keep with
you, Lord Timon!
TIMON:
Ready for his friends.
APEMANTUS:
What a coil's here!
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs.
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.
TIMON:
Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen
I would be good to thee.
APEMANTUS:
No, I'll nothing; for if I should be brib'd too, there
would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin
the faster. Thou giv'st so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give
away thyself in paper shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps,
and vain-glories?
TIMON:
Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to
give regard to you. Farewell; and come with better music.
APEMANTUS:
So. Thou wilt not hear me now: thou shalt not then. I'll
lock thy heaven from thee.
O that men's ears should be
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
SENATOR:
And late, five thousand. To Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty moe
Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight,
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
Can sound his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
Caphis, I say!
CAPHIS:
Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
SENATOR:
Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon;
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceas'd
With slight denial, nor then silenc'd when
'Commend me to your master' and the cap
Plays in the right hand, thus; but tell him
My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
Out of mine own; his days and times are past,
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Have smit my credit. I love and honour him,
But must not break my back to heal his finger.
Immediate are my needs, and my relief
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
But find supply immediate. Get you gone;
Put on a most importunate aspect,
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
When every feather sticks in his own wing,
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
CAPHIS:
I go, sir.
SENATOR:
Take the bonds along with you,
And have the dates in compt.
CAPHIS:
I will, sir.
SENATOR:
Go.
FLAVIUS:
No care, no stop! So senseless of expense
That he will neither know how to maintain it
Nor cease his flow of riot; takes no account
How things go from him, nor resumes no care
Of what is to continue. Never mind
Was to be so unwise to be so kind.
What shall be done? He will not hear till feel.
I must be round with him. Now he comes from hunting.
Fie, fie, fie, fie!
CAPHIS:
Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?
VARRO'S SERVANT:
Is't not your business too?
CAPHIS:
It is. And yours too, Isidore?
ISIDORE'S SERVANT:
It is so.
CAPHIS:
Would we were all discharg'd!
VARRO'S SERVANT:
I fear it.
CAPHIS:
Here comes the lord.
TIMON:
So soon as dinner's done we'll forth again,
My Alcibiades.- With me? What is your will?
CAPHIS:
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
TIMON:
Dues! Whence are you?
CAPHIS:
Of Athens here, my lord.
TIMON:
Go to my steward.
CAPHIS:
Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
To the succession of new days this month.
My master is awak'd by great occasion
To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
That with your other noble parts you'll suit
In giving him his right.
TIMON:
Mine honest friend,
I prithee but repair to me next morning.
CAPHIS:
Nay, good my lord-
TIMON:
Contain thyself, good friend.
VARRO'S SERVANT:
One Varro's servant, my good lord-
ISIDORE'S SERVANT:
From Isidore: he humbly prays your speedy
payment-
CAPHIS:
If you did know, my lord, my master's wants-
VARRO'S SERVANT:
'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and
past.
ISIDORE'S SERVANT:
Your steward puts me off, my lord; and
I am sent expressly to your lordship.
TIMON:
Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
I'll wait upon you instantly.
How goes the world that I am thus encount'red
With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Against my honour?
FLAVIUS:
Please you, gentlemen,
The time is unagreeable to this business.
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
That I may make his lordship understand
Wherefore you are not paid.
TIMON:
Do so, my friends.
See them well entertain'd.
FLAVIUS:
Pray draw near.
CAPHIS:
Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus.
Let's ha' some sport with 'em.
VARRO'S SERVANT:
Hang him, he'll abuse us!
ISIDORE'S SERVANT:
A plague upon him, dog!
VARRO'S SERVANT:
How dost, fool?
APEMANTUS:
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
VARRO'S SERVANT:
I speak not to thee.
APEMANTUS:
No, 'tis to thyself. Come away.
ISIDORE'S SERVANT:
[To VARRO'S SERVANT] There's the fool hangs on
your back already.
APEMANTUS:
No, thou stand'st single; th'art not on him yet.
CAPHIS:
Where's the fool now?
APEMANTUS:
He last ask'd the question. Poor rogues and usurers'
men! Bawds between gold and want!
ALL SERVANTS:
What are we, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Asses.
ALL SERVANTS:
Why?
APEMANTUS:
That you ask me what you are, and do not know
yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
FOOL:
How do you, gentlemen?
ALL SERVANTS:
Gramercies, good fool. How does your mistress?
FOOL:
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you
are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
APEMANTUS:
Good! gramercy.
FOOL:
Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
PAGE:
[To the FOOL] Why, how now, Captain? What do you in this wise
company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS:
Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee
profitably!
PAGE:
Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these
letters; I know not which is which.
APEMANTUS:
Canst not read?
PAGE:
No.
APEMANTUS:
There will little learning die, then, that day thou art
hang'd. This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades. Go; thou wast
born a bastard, and thou't die a bawd.
PAGE:
Thou wast whelp'd a dog, and thou shalt famish dog's death.
Answer not: I am gone.
APEMANTUS:
E'en so thou outrun'st grace.
Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon's.
FOOL:
Will you leave me there?
APEMANTUS:
If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
ALL SERVANTS:
Ay; would they serv'd us!
APEMANTUS:
So would I- as good a trick as ever hangman serv'd
thief.
FOOL:
Are you three usurers' men?
ALL SERVANTS:
Ay, fool.
FOOL:
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant. My mistress
is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your
masters, they approach sadly and go away merry; but they enter my
mistress' house merrily and go away sadly. The reason of this?
VARRO'S SERVANT:
I could render one.
APEMANTUS:
Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a
knave; which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.
VARRO'S SERVANT:
What is a whoremaster, fool?
FOOL:
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a
spirit. Sometime 't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer;
sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than's
artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and, generally,
in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to
thirteen, this spirit walks in.
VARRO'S SERVANT:
Thou art not altogether a fool.
FOOL:
Nor thou altogether a wise man.
As much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack'st.
APEMANTUS:
That answer might have become Apemantus.
VARRO'S SERVANT:
Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
APEMANTUS:
Come with me, fool, come.
FOOL:
I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman;
sometime the philosopher.
FLAVIUS:
Pray you walk near; I'll speak with you anon.
TIMON:
You make me marvel wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
That I might so have rated my expense
As I had leave of means.
FLAVIUS:
You would not hear me
At many leisures I propos'd.
TIMON:
Go to;
Perchance some single vantages you took
When my indisposition put you back,
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself.
FLAVIUS:
O my good lord,
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off
And say you found them in mine honesty.
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
Yea, 'gainst th' authority of manners, pray'd you
To hold your hand more close. I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My lov'd lord,
Though you hear now- too late!- yet now's a time:
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.
TIMON:
Let all my land be sold.
FLAVIUS:
'Tis all engag'd, some forfeited and gone;
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues. The future comes apace;
What shall defend the interim? And at length
How goes our reck'ning?
TIMON:
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
FLAVIUS:
O my good lord, the world is but a word;
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
How quickly were it gone!
TIMON:
You tell me true.
FLAVIUS:
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
Call me before th' exactest auditors
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
When all our offices have been oppress'd
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock
And set mine eyes at flow.
TIMON:
Prithee no more.
FLAVIUS:
'Heavens,' have I said 'the bounty of this lord!
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted! Who is not Lord Timon's?
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!'
Ah! when the means are gone that buy this praise,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter show'rs,
These flies are couch'd.
TIMON:
Come, sermon me no further.
No villainous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart:
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.
FLAVIUS:
Assurance bless your thoughts!
TIMON:
And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd
That I account them blessings; for by these
Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
SERVANTS:
My lord! my lord!
TIMON:
I will dispatch you severally- you to Lord Lucius; to Lord
Lucullus you; I hunted with his honour to-day. You to Sempronius.
Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions
have found time to use 'em toward a supply of money. Let the
request be fifty talents.
FLAMINIUS:
As you have said, my lord.
FLAVIUS:
[Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!
TIMON:
Go you, sir, to the senators,
Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
Deserv'd this hearing. Bid 'em send o' th' instant
A thousand talents to me.
FLAVIUS:
I have been bold,
For that I knew it the most general way,
To them to use your signet and your name;
But they do shake their heads, and I am here
No richer in return.
TIMON:
Is't true? Can't be?
FLAVIUS:
They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
Do what they would, are sorry- you are honourable-
But yet they could have wish'd- they know not-
Something hath been amiss- a noble nature
May catch a wrench- would all were well!- 'tis pity-
And so, intending other serious matters,
After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods,
They froze me into silence.
TIMON:
You gods, reward them!
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary.
Their blood is cak'd, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
Is fashion'd for the journey dull and heavy.
Go to Ventidius. Prithee be not sad,
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately
Buried his father, by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate. When he was poor,
Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,
I clear'd him with five talents. Greet him from me,
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb'red
With those five talents. That had, give't these fellows
To whom 'tis instant due. Nev'r speak or think
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
FLAVIUS:
I would I could not think it.
That thought is bounty's foe;
Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
SERVANT:
I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
FLAMINIUS:
I thank you, sir.
SERVANT:
Here's my lord.
LUCULLUS:
[Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? A gift, I warrant. Why,
this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to-night-
Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome,
sir. Fill me some wine. And how does that
honourable, complete, freehearted gentleman of Athens, thy very
bountiful good lord and master?
FLAMINIUS:
His health is well, sir.
LUCULLUS:
I am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what
hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
FLAMINIUS:
Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord's
behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply;
great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to
your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present
assistance therein.
LUCULLIUS:
La, la, la, la! 'Nothing doubting' says he? Alas, good
lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a
house. Many a time and often I ha' din'd with him and told him
on't; and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him
spend less; and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his. I ha'
told him on't, but I could ne'er get him from't.
SERVANT:
Please your lordship, here is the wine.
LUCULLUS:
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
FLAMINIUS:
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
LUCULLUS:
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit,
give thee thy due, and one that knows what belongs to reason, and
canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in
thee. Get you gone, sirrah. Draw
nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman; but
thou art wise, and thou know'st well enough, although thou com'st
to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare
friendship without security. Here's three solidares for thee.
Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw'st me not. Fare thee well.
FLAMINIUS:
Is't possible the world should so much differ,
And we alive that liv'd? Fly, damned baseness,
To him that worships thee.
LUCULLUS:
Ha! Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
FLAMINIUS:
May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Let molten coin be thy damnation,
Thou disease of a friend and not himself!
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
I feel my master's passion! This slave
Unto his honour has my lord's meat in him;
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
When he is turn'd to poison?
O, may diseases only work upon't!
And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
Which my lord paid for be of any power
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!
LUCIUS:
Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an
honourable gentleman.
FIRST STRANGER:
We know him for no less, though we are but
strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours
are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
LUCIUS:
Fie, no: do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
SECOND STRANGER:
But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago
talents; nay, urg'd extremely for't, and showed what necessity
belong'd to't, and yet was denied.
LUCIUS:
How?
SECOND STRANGER:
I tell you, denied, my lord.
LUCIUS:
What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am
asham'd on't. Denied that honourable man! There was very little
honour show'd in't. For my own part, I must needs confess I have
received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels,
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet, had he
mistook him and sent to me, I should ne'er have denied his
occasion so many talents.
SERVILIUS:
See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see
his honour.- My honour'd lord!
LUCIUS:
Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well; commend
me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.
SERVILIUS:
May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-
LUCIUS:
Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord:
he's ever sending. How shall I thank him, think'st thou? And what
has he sent now?
SERVILIUS:
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord,
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
talents.
LUCIUS:
I know his lordship is but merry with me;
He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.
SERVILIUS:
But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully.
LUCIUS:
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
SERVILIUS:
Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.
LUCIUS:
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such
a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! How
unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a
little part and undo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now
before the gods, I am not able to do- the more beast, I say! I
was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can
witness; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't
now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his
honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power
to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my
greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far
as to use mine own words to him?
SERVILIUS:
Yes, sir, I shall.
LUCIUS:
I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
FIRST STRANGER:
Do you observe this, Hostilius?
SECOND STRANGER:
Ay, too well.
FIRST STRANGER:
Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him his friend
That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing,
Timon has been this lord's father,
And kept his credit with his purse;
Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
Has paid his men their wages. He ne'er drinks
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
And yet- O, see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-
He does deny him, in respect of his,
What charitable men afford to beggars.
THIRD STRANGER:
Religion groans at it.
FIRST STRANGER:
For mine own part,
I never tasted Timon in my life,
Nor came any of his bounties over me
To mark me for his friend; yet I protest,
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,
And honourable carriage,
Had his necessity made use of me,
I would have put my wealth into donation,
And the best half should have return'd to him,
So much I love his heart. But I perceive
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
For policy sits above conscience.
SEMPRONIUS:
Must he needs trouble me in't? Hum! 'Bove all others?
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
Whom he redeem'd from prison. All these
Owe their estates unto him.
SERVANT:
My lord,
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
They have all denied him.
SEMPRONIUS:
How! Have they denied him?
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
And does he send to me? Three? Humh!
It shows but little love or judgment in him.
Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
Thrice give him over. Must I take th' cure upon me?
Has much disgrac'd me in't; I'm angry at him,
That might have known my place. I see no sense for't,
But his occasions might have woo'd me first;
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
That e'er received gift from him.
And does he think so backwardly of me now
That I'll requite it last? No;
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To th' rest, and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool.
I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
And with their faint reply this answer join:
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
SERVANT:
Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The devil
knew not what he did when he made man politic- he cross'd himself
by't; and I cannot think but, in the end
SATURNINUS:
Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
And, countrymen, my loving followers,
Plead my successive title with your swords.
I am his first born son that was the last
That ware the imperial diadem of Rome;
Then let my father's honours live in me,
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
BASSIANUS:
Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
Keep then this passage to the Capitol;
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
To justice, continence, and nobility;
But let desert in pure election shine;
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
MARCUS:
Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
Ambitiously for rule and empery,
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
A special party, have by common voice
In election for the Roman empery
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
For many good and great deserts to Rome.
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
Lives not this day within the city walls.
He by the Senate is accited home,
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,
That with his sons, a terror to our foes,
Hath yok'd a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
Our enemies' pride; five times he hath return'd
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
In coffins from the field; and at this day
To the monument of that Andronici
Done sacrifice of expiation,
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.
And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
Let us entreat, by honour of his name
Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
SATURNINUS:
How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.
BASSIANUS:
Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
In thy uprightness and integrity,
And so I love and honour thee and thine,
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
And to my fortunes and the people's favour
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
SATURNINUS:
Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
And to the love and favour of my country
Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
As I am confident and kind to thee.
Open the gates and let me in.
BASSIANUS:
Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
CAPTAIN:
Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
Successful in the battles that he fights,
With honour and with fortune is return'd
From where he circumscribed with his sword
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
TITUS:
Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
Returns with precious lading to the bay
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
To re-salute his country with his tears,
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
Thou great defender of this Capitol,
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
Half of the number that King Priam had,
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
These that survive let Rome reward with love;
These that I bring unto their latest home,
With burial amongst their ancestors.
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own,
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
Make way to lay them by their brethren.
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.
O sacred receptacle of my joys,
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
How many sons hast thou of mine in store
That thou wilt never render to me more!
LUCIUS:
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
Before this earthy prison of their bones,
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
TITUS:
I give him you- the noblest that survives,
The eldest son of this distressed queen.
TAMORA:
Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
O, think my son to be as dear to me!
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
To beautify thy triumphs, and return
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
For valiant doings in their country's cause?
O, if to fight for king and commonweal
Were piety in thine, it is in these.
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
Draw near them then in being merciful.
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
TITUS:
Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
Religiously they ask a sacrifice.
To this your son is mark'd, and die he must
T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
LUCIUS:
Away with him, and make a fire straight;
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
TAMORA:
O cruel, irreligious piety!
CHIRON:
Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
DEMETRIUS:
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths-
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen-
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
LUCIUS:
See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
TITUS:
Let it be so, and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,
No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
LAVINIA:
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
My noble lord and father, live in fame!
Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
I render for my brethren's obsequies;
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
TITUS:
Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
MARCUS:
Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
TITUS:
Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
MARCUS:
And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
You that survive and you that sleep in fame.
Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all
That in your country's service drew your swords;
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
Send thee by me, their Tribune and their trust,
This par]iament of white and spotless hue;
And name thee in election for the empire
With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:
Be candidatus then, and put it on,
And help to set a head on headless Rome.
TITUS:
A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
What should I don this robe and trouble you?
Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
And set abroad new business for you all?
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
And led my country's strength successfully,
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
In right and service of their noble country.
Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
But not a sceptre to control the world.
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
MARCUS:
Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
SATURNINUS:
Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?
TITUS:
Patience, Prince Saturninus.
SATURNINUS:
Romans, do me right.
Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
Till Saturninus be Rome's Emperor.
Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
LUCIUS:
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
TITUS:
Content thee, Prince; I will restore to thee
The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
BASSIANUS:
Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
But honour thee, and will do till I die.
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed.
TITUS:
People of Rome, and people's Tribunes here,
I ask your voices and your suffrages:
Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
TRIBUNES:
To gratify the good Andronicus,
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
The people will accept whom he admits.
TITUS:
Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
That you create our Emperor's eldest son,
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
And ripen justice in this commonweal.
Then, if you will elect by my advice,
Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'
MARCUS:
With voices and applause of every sort,
Patricians and plebeians, we create
Lord Saturninus Rome's great Emperor;
And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
SATURNINUS:
Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
To us in our election this day
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;
And for an onset, Titus, to advance
Thy name and honourable family,
Lavinia will I make my emperess,
Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
TITUS:
It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match
I hold me highly honoured of your Grace,
And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,
King and commander of our commonweal,
The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate
My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,
Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord;
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
SATURNINUS:
Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record; and when I do forget
The least of these unspeakable deserts,
Romans, forget your fealty to me.
TITUS:
[To TAMORA]
To him that for your honour and your state
Will use you nobly and your followers.
SATURNINUS:
[Aside]
That I would choose, were I to choose anew.-
Clear up, fair Queen, that cloudy countenance;
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-
Princely shall be thy usage every way.
Rest on my word, and let not discontent
Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
LAVINIA:
Not I, my lord, sith true nobility
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
SATURNINUS:
Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go.
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.
Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
BASSIANUS:
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
TITUS:
How, sir! Are you in earnest then, my lord?
BASSIANUS:
Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal
To do myself this reason and this right.
MARCUS:
Suum cuique is our Roman justice:
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
LUCIUS:
And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
TITUS:
Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
Treason, my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd!
SATURNINUS:
Surpris'd! By whom?
BASSIANUS:
By him that justly may
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
MUTIUS:
Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
TITUS:
Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
MUTIUS:
My lord, you pass not here.
TITUS:
What, villain boy!
Bar'st me my way in Rome?
MUTIUS:
Help, Lucius, help!
LUCIUS:
My lord, you are unjust, and more than so:
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
TITUS:
Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine;
My sons would never so dishonour me.
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor.
LUCIUS:
Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
That is another's lawful promis'd love.
SATURNINUS:
No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,
Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.
I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;
Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
TITUS:
O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
SATURNINUS:
But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
TITUS:
These words are razors to my wounded heart.
SATURNINUS:
And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths,
That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs,
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride
And will create thee Emperess of Rome.
Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
And here I swear by all the Roman gods-
Sith priest and holy water are so near,
And tapers burn so bright, and everything
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
TAMORA:
And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
She will a handmaid be to his desires,
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
SATURNINUS:
Ascend, fair Queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride,
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered;
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
TITUS:
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?
MARCUS:
O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
TITUS:
No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
That hath dishonoured all our family;
Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!
LUCIUS:
But let us give him burial, as becomes;
Give Mutius burial with our bretheren.
TITUS:
Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb.
This monument five hundred years hath stood,
Which I have sumptuously re-edified;
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls.
Bury him where you can, he comes not here.
MARCUS:
My lord, this is impiety in you.
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;
He must be buried with his bretheren.
TITUS:
'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?
QUINTUS:
He that would vouch it in any place but here.
TITUS:
What, would you bury him in my despite?
MARCUS:
No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
TITUS:
Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.
My foes I do repute you every one;
So trouble me no more, but get you gone.
MARTIUS:
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
QUINTUS:
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
MARCUS:
Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-
QUINTUS:
Father, and in that name doth nature speak-
TITUS:
Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
MARCUS:
Renowned Titus, more than half my soul-
LUCIUS:
Dear father, soul and substance of us all-
MARCUS:
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
Thou art a Roman- be not barbarous.
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
Did graciously plead for his funerals.
Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,
Be barr'd his entrance here.
TITUS:
Rise, Marcus, rise;
The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw,
To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome!
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
LUCIUS:
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
ALL:
[Kneeling]
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
MARCUS:
My lord- to step out of these dreary dumps-
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome?
TITUS:
I know not, Marcus, but I know it is-
Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.
Is she not, then, beholding to the man
That brought her for this high good turn so far?
MARCUS:
Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
at the other door, BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, with others
SATURNINUS:
So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
BASSIANUS:
And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.
SATURNINUS:
Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
BASSIANUS:
Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
My true betrothed love, and now my wife?
But let the laws of Rome determine all;
Meanwhile am I possess'd of that is mine.
SATURNINUS:
'Tis good, sir. You are very short with us;
But if we live we'll be as sharp with you.
BASSIANUS:
My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd,
That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
In zeal to you, and highly mov'd to wrath
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave.
Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
TITUS:
Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
How I have lov'd and honoured Saturnine!
TAMORA:
My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
SATURNINUS:
What, madam! be dishonoured openly,
And basely put it up without revenge?
TAMORA:
Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonour you!
But on mine honour dare I undertake
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all,
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
Then at my suit look graciously on him;
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.
You are but newly planted in your throne;
Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
Upon a just survey take Titus' part,
And so supplant you for ingratitude,
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
Yield at entreats, and then let me alone:
I'll find a day to massacre them all,
And raze their faction and their family,
The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.-
Come, come, sweet Emperor; come, Andronicus.
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
SATURNINUS:
Rise, Titus, rise; my Empress hath prevail'd.
TITUS:
I thank your Majesty and her, my lord;
These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
TAMORA:
Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
A Roman now adopted happily,
And must advise the Emperor for his good.
This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
That I have reconcil'd your friends and you.
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
My word and promise to the Emperor
That you will be more mild and tractable.
And fear not, lords- and you, Lavinia.
By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.
LUCIUS:
We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
That what we did was mildly as we might,
Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.
MARCUS:
That on mine honour here do I protest.
SATURNINUS:
Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
TAMORA:
Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.
The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.
I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back.
SATURNINUS:
Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
I do remit these young men's heinous faults.
Stand up.
Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
I found a friend; and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,
You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
TITUS:
To-morrow, and it please your Majesty
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bonjour.
SATURNINUS:
Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
AARON:
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
Safe out of Fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
So Tamora.
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long.
Hast prisoner held, fett'red in amorous chains,
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,
To wait upon this new-made emperess.
To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
Hullo! what storm is this?
DEMETRIUS:
Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge
And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.
CHIRON:
Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace;
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
AARON:
[Aside]
peace.
DEMETRIUS:
Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it.
CHIRON:
Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
DEMETRIUS:
Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
AARON:
[Coming forward]
So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw
And maintain such a quarrel openly?
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
I would not for a million of gold
The cause were known to them it most concerns;
Nor would your noble mother for much more
Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome.
For shame, put up.
DEMETRIUS:
Not I, till I have sheath'd
My rapier in his bosom, and withal
Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here.
CHIRON:
For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd,
Foul-spoken coward, that thund'rest with thy tongue,
And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.
AARON:
Away, I say!
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
This pretty brabble will undo us all.
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
It is to jet upon a prince's right?
What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
Or Bassianus so degenerate,
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
Young lords, beware; an should the Empress know
This discord's ground, the music would not please.
CHIRON:
I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
I love Lavinia more than all the world.
DEMETRIUS:
Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
Lavina is thine elder brother's hope.
AARON:
Why, are ye mad, or know ye not in Rome
How furious and impatient they be,
And cannot brook competitors in love?
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
By this device.
CHIRON:
Aaron, a thousand deaths
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
AARON:
To achieve her- how?
DEMETRIUS:
Why mak'st thou it so strange?
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
She is a woman, therefore may be won;
She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.
What, man! more water glideth by the mill
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
AARON:
[Aside]
DEMETRIUS:
Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words, fair looks, and liberality?
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
AARON:
Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
Would serve your turns.
CHIRON:
Ay, so the turn were served.
DEMETRIUS:
Aaron, thou hast hit it.
AARON:
Would you had hit it too!
Then should not we be tir'd with this ado.
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
To square for this? Would it offend you, then,
That both should speed?
CHIRON:
Faith, not me.
DEMETRIUS:
Nor me, so I were one.
AARON:
For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
That you affect; and so must you resolve
That what you cannot as you would achieve,
You must perforce accomplish as you may.
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;
The forest walks are wide and spacious,
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.
Single you thither then this dainty doe,
And strike her home by force if not by words.
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
Come, come, our Empress, with her sacred wit
To villainy and vengeance consecrate,
Will we acquaint with all what we intend;
And she shall file our engines with advice
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
But to your wishes' height advance you both.
The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.
There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;
There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
CHIRON:
Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
DEMETRIUS:
Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,
Per Styga, per manes vehor.
TITUS:
The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.
Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
That all the court may echo with the noise.
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
To attend the Emperor's person carefully.
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd.
Many good morrows to your Majesty!
Madam, to you as many and as good!
I promised your Grace a hunter's peal.
SATURNINUS:
And you have rung it lustily, my lords-
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
BASSIANUS:
Lavinia, how say you?
LAVINIA:
I say no;
I have been broad awake two hours and more.
SATURNINUS:
Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,
And to our sport. Madam, now shall ye see
Our Roman hunting.
MARCUS:
I have dogs, my lord,
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
And climb the highest promontory top.
TITUS:
And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.
DEMETRIUS:
Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
AARON:
He that had wit would think that I had none,
To bury so much gold under a tree
And never after to inherit it.
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
Which, cunningly effected, will beget
A very excellent piece of villainy.
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
That have their alms out of the Empress' chest.
TAMORA:
My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad
When everything does make a gleeful boast?
The birds chant melody on every bush;
The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun;
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground;
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
As if a double hunt were heard at once,
Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise;
And- after conflict such as was suppos'd
The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed,
When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Be unto us as is a nurse's song
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
AARON:
Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
Saturn is dominator over mine.
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution?
No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,
And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.
Now question me no more; we are espied.
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
TAMORA:
Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
AARON:
No more, great Empress: Bassianus comes.
Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.
BASSIANUS:
Who have we here? Rome's royal Emperess,
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
Or is it Dian, habited like her,
Who hath abandoned her holy groves
To see the general hunting in this forest?
TAMORA:
Saucy controller of my private steps!
Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had,
Thy temples should be planted presently
With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
LAVINIA:
Under your patience, gentle Emperess,
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Are singled forth to try thy experiments.
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
BASSIANUS:
Believe me, Queen, your swarth Cimmerian
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
Spotted, detested, and abominable.
Why are you sequest'red from all your train,
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
And wand'red hither to an obscure plot,
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
If foul desire had not conducted you?
LAVINIA:
And, being intercepted in your sport,
Great reason that my noble lord be rated
For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,
And let her joy her raven-coloured love;
This valley fits the purpose passing well.
BASSIANUS:
The King my brother shall have notice of this.
LAVINIA:
Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.
Good king, to be so mightily abused!
TAMORA:
Why, I have patience to endure all this.
DEMETRIUS:
How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?
TAMORA:
Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
Would make such fearful and confused cries
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.
No sooner had they told this hellish tale
But straight they told me they would bind me here
Unto the body of a dismal yew,
And leave me to this miserable death.
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
That ever ear did hear to such effect;
And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
This vengeance on me had they executed.
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
DEMETRIUS:
This is a witness that I am thy son.
CHIRON:
And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
LAVINIA:
Ay, come, Semiramis- nay, barbarous Tamora,
For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
TAMORA:
Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
DEMETRIUS:
Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her;
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.
This minion stood upon her chastity,
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;
And shall she carry this unto her grave?
CHIRON:
An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
TAMORA:
But when ye have the honey we desire,
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
CHIRON:
I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
LAVINIA:
O Tamora! thou bearest a woman's face-
TAMORA:
I will not hear her speak; away with her!
LAVINIA:
Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
DEMETRIUS:
Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
To see her tears; but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
LAVINIA:
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
O, do not learn her wrath- she taught it thee;
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble,
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
CHIRON:
What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
LAVINIA:
'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark.
Yet have I heard- O, could I find it now!-
The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure
To have his princely paws par'd all away.
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
TAMORA:
I know not what it means; away with her!
LAVINIA:
O, let me teach thee! For my father's sake,
That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
TAMORA:
Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
Even for his sake am I pitiless.
Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain
To save your brother from the sacrifice;
But fierce Andronicus would not relent.
Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;
The worse to her the better lov'd of me.
LAVINIA:
O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
TAMORA:
What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
LAVINIA:
'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
Where never man's eye may behold my body;
Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
TAMORA:
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee;
No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
DEMETRIUS:
Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
LAVINIA:
No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,
The blot and enemy to our general name!
Confusion fall-
CHIRON:
Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband.
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
TAMORA:
Farewell, my sons; see that you make her sure.
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
Till all the Andronici be made away.
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.
AARON:
Come on, my lords, the better foot before;
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
QUINTUS:
My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
MARTIUS:
And mine, I promise you; were it not for shame,
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
QUINTUS:
What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this,
Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,
Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
A very fatal place it seems to me.
Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
MARTIUS:
O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
AARON:
[Aside]
That he thereby may have a likely guess
How these were they that made away his brother.
MARTIUS:
Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole?
QUINTUS:
I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
MARTIUS:
To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
Aaron and thou look down into this den,
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
QUINTUS:
Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
O, tell me who it is, for ne'er till now
Was I a child to fear I know not what.
MARTIUS:
Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood,
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
QUINTUS:
If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
MARTIUS:
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
Which, like a taper in some monument,
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit;
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood.
O brother, help me with thy fainting hand-
If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath-
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
QUINTUS:
Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
MARTIUS:
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
QUINTUS:
Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
Till thou art here aloft, or I below.
Thou canst not come to me- I come to thee.
SATURNINUS:
Along with me! I'll see what hole is here,
And what he is that now is leapt into it.
Say, who art thou that lately didst descend
Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
MARTIUS:
The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
SATURNINUS:
My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
He and his lady both are at the lodge
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
MARTIUS:
We know not where you left them all alive;
But, out alas! here have we found him dead.
TAMORA:
Where is my lord the King?
SATURNINUS:
Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.
TAMORA:
Where is thy brother Bassianus?
SATURNINUS:
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound;
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
TAMORA:
Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
The complot of this timeless tragedy;
And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
SATURNINUS. 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely,
Sweet huntsman- Bassianus 'tis we mean-
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him.
Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
Among the nettles at the elder-tree
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
This is the pit and this the elder-tree.
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
That should have murdered Bassianus here.
AARON:
My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
SATURNINUS:
[To TITUS]
Have here bereft my brother of his life.
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison;
There let them bide until we have devis'd
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
TAMORA:
What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
How easily murder is discovered!
TITUS:
High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
That this fell fault of my accursed sons-
Accursed if the fault be prov'd in them-
SATURNINUS:
If it be prov'd! You see it is apparent.
Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
TAMORA:
Andronicus himself did take it up.
TITUS:
I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;
For, by my fathers' reverend tomb, I vow
They shall be ready at your Highness' will
To answer their suspicion with their lives.
SATURNINUS:
Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.
Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers;
Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain;
For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
That end upon them should be executed.
TAMORA:
Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
TITUS:
Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
DEMETRIUS:
So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.
CHIRON:
Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
DEMETRIUS:
See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
CHIRON:
Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
DEMETRIUS:
She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
CHIRON:
An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
DEMETRIUS:
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
MARCUS:
Who is this?- my niece, that flies away so fast?
Cousin, a word: where is your husband?
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
And might not gain so great a happiness
As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
Coming and going with thy honey breath.
But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
O, had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made,
He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
O, could our mourning case thy misery!
TITUS:
Hear me, grave fathers; noble Tribunes, stay!
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd,
And for these bitter tears, which now you see
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
For two and twenty sons I never wept,
Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
O reverend Tribunes! O gentle aged men!
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
And let me say, that never wept before,
My tears are now prevailing orators.
LUCIUS:
O noble father, you lament in vain;
The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by,
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
TITUS:
Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
Grave Tribunes, once more I entreat of you.
LUCIUS:
My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
TITUS:
Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
They would not mark me; if they did mark,
They would not pity me; yet plead I must,
And bootless unto them.
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
Who though they cannot answer my distress,
Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,
For that they will not intercept my tale.
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me;
And were they but attired in grave weeds,
Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
LUCIUS:
To rescue my two brothers from their death;
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
My everlasting doom of banishment.
TITUS:
O happy man! they have befriended thee.
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine; how happy art thou then
From these devourers to be banished!
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
MARCUS:
Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
Or if not so, thy noble heart to break.
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
TITUS:
Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
MARCUS:
This was thy daughter.
TITUS:
Why, Marcus, so she is.
LUCIUS:
Ay me! this object kills me.
TITUS:
Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea,
Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too,
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;
In bootless prayer have they been held up,
And they have serv'd me to effectless use.
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
For hands to do Rome service is but vain.
LUCIUS:
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
MARCUS:
O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
LUCIUS:
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
MARCUS:
O, thus I found her straying in the park,
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound.
TITUS:
It was my dear, and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead;
For now I stand as one upon a rock,
Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
It would have madded me; what shall I do
Now I behold thy lively body so?
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee;
Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew
Upon a gath'red lily almost withered.
MARCUS:
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
Perchance because she knows them innocent.
TITUS:
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry
With miry slime left on them by a flood?
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
Plot some device of further misery
To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
LUCIUS:
Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
MARCUS:
Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
TITUS:
Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
LUCIUS:
Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
TITUS:
Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
That to her brother which I said to thee:
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
O, what a sympathy of woe is this
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
AARON:
Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
Or any one of you, chop off your hand
And send it to the King: he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
TITUS:
O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
Did ever raven sing so like a lark
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand.
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
LUCIUS:
Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
That hath thrown down so many enemies,
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn,
My youth can better spare my blood than you,
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
MARCUS:
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
O, none of both but are of high desert!
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death;
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
AARON:
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
For fear they die before their pardon come.
MARCUS:
My hand shall go.
LUCIUS:
By heaven, it shall not go!
TITUS:
Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
LUCIUS:
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
MARCUS:
And for our father's sake and mother's care,
Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
TITUS:
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
LUCIUS:
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
MARCUS:
But I will use the axe.
TITUS:
Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both;
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
AARON:
[Aside]
And never whilst I live deceive men so;
But I'll deceive you in another sort,
And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
TITUS:
Now stay your strife. What shall be is dispatch'd.
Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand;
Tell him it was a hand that warded him
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it.
More hath it merited- that let it have.
As for my sons, say I account of them
As jewels purchas'd at an easy price;
And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
AARON:
I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace:
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
TITUS:
O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;
If any power pities wretched tears,
To that I call! What, would'st thou kneel with me?
Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
MARCUS:
O brother, speak with possibility,
And do not break into these deep extremes.
TITUS:
Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
Then be my passions bottomless with them.
MARCUS:
But yet let reason govern thy lament.
TITUS:
If there were reason for these miseries,
Then into limits could I bind my woes.
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth;
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
Then must my earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
MESSENGER:
Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor.
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back-
Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mock'd,
That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
More than remembrance of my father's death.
MARCUS:
Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
These miseries are more than may be borne.
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
But sorrow flouted at is double death.
LUCIUS:
Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
That ever death should let life bear his name,
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
MARCUS:
Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
As frozen water to a starved snake.
TITUS:
When will this fearful slumber have an end?
MARCUS:
Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
Thou dost not slumber: see thy two sons' heads,
Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here;
Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
Ah! now no more will I control thy griefs.
Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
The closing up of our most wretched eyes.
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
TITUS:
Ha, ha, ha!
MARCUS:
Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
TITUS:
Why, I have not another tear to shed;
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears.
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
Even in their throats that have committed them.
Come, let me see what task I have to do.
You heavy people, circle me about,
That I may turn me to each one of you
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
And in this hand the other will I bear.
And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
And if ye love me, as I think you do,
Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
LUCIUS:
Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome.
Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life.
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs
And make proud Saturnine and his emperess
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a pow'r
To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine.
TITUS:
So so, now sit; and look you eat no more
Than will preserve just so much strength in us
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot;
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
Then thus I thump it down.
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
Or get some little knife between thy teeth
And just against thy heart make thou a hole,
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
May run into that sink and, soaking in,
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
MARCUS:
Fie, brother, fie! Teach her not thus to lay
Such violent hands upon her tender life.
TITUS:
How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands?
To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
Lest we remember still that we have none.
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
As if we should forget we had no hands,
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says-
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks.
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
As begging hermits in their holy prayers.
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
But I of these will wrest an alphabet,
And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.
BOY:
Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
MARCUS:
Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,
Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
TITUS:
Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
MARCUS:
At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
TITUS:
Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny;
A deed of death done on the innocent
Becomes not Titus' brother. Get thee gone;
I see thou art not for my company.
MARCUS:
Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
TITUS:
'But!' How if that fly had a father and mother?
How would he hang his slender gilded wings
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
Poor harmless fly,
That with his pretty buzzing melody
Came here to make us merry! And thou hast kill'd him.
MARCUS:
Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favour'd fly,
Like to the Empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.
TITUS:
O, O, O!
Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
For thou hast done a charitable deed.
Give me thy knife, I will insult on him,
Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
Come hither purposely to poison me.
There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
Ah, sirrah!
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low
But that between us we can kill a fly
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
MARCUS:
Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
He takes false shadows for true substances.
TITUS:
Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me;
I'll to thy closet, and go read with thee
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
Come, boy, and go with me; thy sight is young,
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
BOY:
Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
Follows me everywhere, I know not why.
Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
MARCUS:
Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
TITUS:
She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
BOY:
Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
MARCUS:
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
TITUS:
Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.
Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
MARCUS:
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
BOY:
My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear;
Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
And would not, but in fury, fright my youth;
Which made me down to throw my books, and fly-
Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt;
And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
MARCUS:
Lucius, I will.
TITUS:
How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
Some book there is that she desires to see.
Which is it, girl, of these?- Open them, boy.-
But thou art deeper read and better skill'd;
Come and take choice of all my library,
And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
MARCUS:
I think she means that there were more than one
Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was,
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
TITUS:
Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
BOY:
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
My mother gave it me.
MARCUS:
For love of her that's gone,
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
TITUS:
Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
This is the tragic tale of Philomel
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;
And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.
MARCUS:
See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
TITUS:
Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was,
Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
See, see!
Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt-
O, had we never, never hunted there!-
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
By nature made for murders and for rapes.
MARCUS:
O, why should nature build so foul a den,
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
TITUS:
Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed.
Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
MARCUS:
Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
My lord, look here! Look here, Lavinia!
This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,
This after me. I have writ my name
Without the help of any hand at all.
Curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift!
Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
What God will have discovered for revenge.
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
That we may know the traitors and the truth!
O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
TITUS:
'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
MARCUS:
What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
Performers of this heinous bloody deed?
TITUS:
Magni Dominator poli,
Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
MARCUS:
O, calm thee, gentle lord! although I know
There is enough written upon this earth
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere
And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape-
That we will prosecute, by good advice,
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
And see their blood or die with this reproach.
TITUS:
'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
The dam will wake; and if she wind ye once,
She's with the lion deeply still in league,
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone;
And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
And with a gad of steel will write these words,
And lay it by. The angry northern wind
Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,
And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
BOY:
I say, my lord, that if I were a man
Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
MARCUS:
Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
For his ungrateful country done the like.
BOY:
And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
TITUS:
Come, go with me into mine armoury.
Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal my boy
Shall carry from me to the Empress' sons
Presents that I intend to send them both.
Come, come; thou'lt do my message, wilt thou not?
BOY:
Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
TITUS:
No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house.
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court;
Ay, marry, will we, sir! and we'll be waited on.
MARCUS:
O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
And not relent, or not compassion him?
Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
Than foemen's marks upon his batt'red shield,
But yet so just that he will not revenge.
Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus!
CHIRON:
Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
He hath some message to deliver us.
AARON:
Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
BOY:
My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
I greet your honours from Andronicus-
DEMETRIUS:
Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
BOY:
[Aside]
For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
The goodliest weapons of his armoury
To gratify your honourable youth,
The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
And so I do, and with his gifts present
Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
You may be armed and appointed well.
And so I leave you both- like bloody villains.
DEMETRIUS:
What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
Let's see:
Non eget Mauri iaculis, nec arcu.'
CHIRON:
O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
I read it in the grammar long ago.
AARON:
Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
Here's no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt,
And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
But were our witty Empress well afoot,
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit.
But let her rest in her unrest awhile-
And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
Captives, to be advanced to this height?
It did me good before the palace gate
To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.
DEMETRIUS:
But me more good to see so great a lord
Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
AARON:
Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
DEMETRIUS:
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
CHIRON:
A charitable wish and full of love.
AARON:
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
CHIRON:
And that would she for twenty thousand more.
DEMETRIUS:
Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
For our beloved mother in her pains.
AARON:
[Aside]
DEMETRIUS:
Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
CHIRON:
Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
DEMETRIUS:
Soft! who comes here?
NURSE:
Good morrow, lords.
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
AARON:
Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
NURSE:
O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
AARON:
Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?
NURSE:
O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
Our Empress' shame and stately Rome's disgrace!
She is delivered, lord; she is delivered.
AARON:
To whom?
NURSE:
I mean she is brought a-bed.
AARON:
Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
NURSE:
A devil.
AARON:
Why, then she is the devil's dam;
A joyful issue.
NURSE:
A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime;
The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
AARON:
Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure.
DEMETRIUS:
Villain, what hast thou done?
AARON:
That which thou canst not undo.
CHIRON:
Thou hast undone our mother.
AARON:
Villain, I have done thy mother.
DEMETRIUS:
And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend!
CHIRON:
It shall not live.
AARON:
It shall not die.
NURSE:
Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
AARON:
What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
Do execution on my flesh and blood.
DEMETRIUS:
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
AARON:
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother!
Now, by the burning tapers of the sky
That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
That touches this my first-born son and heir.
I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
With all his threat'ning band of Typhon's brood,
Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
Ye white-lim'd walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
Coal-black is better than another hue
In that it scorns to bear another hue;
For all the water in the ocean
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
Tell the Empress from me I am of age
To keep mine own- excuse it how she can.
DEMETRIUS:
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
AARON:
My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
The vigour and the picture of my youth.
This before all the world do I prefer;
This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
DEMETRIUS:
By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
CHIRON:
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
NURSE:
The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
CHIRON:
I blush to think upon this ignomy.
AARON:
Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
The close enacts and counsels of thy heart!
Here's a young lad fram'd of another leer.
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father,
As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you;
And from your womb where you imprisoned were
He is enfranchised and come to light.
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
Although my seal be stamped in his face.
NURSE:
Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
DEMETRIUS:
Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
And we will all subscribe to thy advice.
Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
AARON:
Then sit we down and let us all consult.
My son and I will have the wind of you:
Keep there; now talk at pleasure of your safety.
DEMETRIUS:
How many women saw this child of his?
AARON:
Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
But say, again, how many saw the child?
NURSE:
Cornelia the midwife and myself;
And no one else but the delivered Empress.
AARON:
The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
Go to the Empress, tell her this I said.
Weeke weeke!
So cries a pig prepared to the spit.
DEMETRIUS:
What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
AARON:
O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours-
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
And now be it known to you my full intent:
Not far, one Muliteus, my countryman-
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
His child is like to her, fair as you are.
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
And tell them both the circumstance of all,
And how by this their child shall be advanc'd,
And be received for the Emperor's heir
And substituted in the place of mine,
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.
Hark ye, lords. You see I have given her physic,
And you must needs bestow her funeral;
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.
This done, see that you take no longer days,
But send the midwife presently to me.
The midwife and the nurse well made away,
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
CHIRON:
Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
With secrets.
DEMETRIUS:
For this care of Tamora,
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
AARON:
Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
To be a warrior and command a camp.
TROILUS:
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.
Why should I war without the walls of Troy
That find such cruel battle here within?
Each Troyan that is master of his heart,
Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none!
PANDARUS:
Will this gear ne'er be mended?
TROILUS:
The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;
But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
Less valiant than the virgin in the night,
And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.
PANDARUS:
Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part,
I'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake
out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
TROILUS:
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS:
Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
TROILUS:
Have I not tarried?
PANDARUS:
Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
TROILUS:
Still have I tarried.
PANDARUS:
Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,
or you may chance to burn your lips.
TROILUS:
Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do.
At Priam's royal table do I sit;
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts-
So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.
PANDARUS:
Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her
look, or any woman else.
TROILUS:
I was about to tell thee: when my heart,
As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.
But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
PANDARUS:
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well,
go to- there were no more comparison between the women. But, for
my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it,
praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
I did. I
TROILUS:
O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-
When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
Reply not in how many fathoms deep
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
In Cressid's love. Thou answer'st 'She is fair'-
Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
Handlest in thy discourse. O, that her hand,
In whose comparison all whites are ink
Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure
The cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense
Hard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell'st me,
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
The knife that made it.
PANDARUS:
I speak no more than truth.
TROILUS:
Thou dost not speak so much.
PANDARUS:
Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if
she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the
mends in her own hands.
TROILUS:
Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!
PANDARUS:
I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of
her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but
small thanks for my labour.
TROILUS:
What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?
PANDARUS:
Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as
Helen. An she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a Friday
as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a
blackamoor; 'tis all one to me.
TROILUS:
Say I she is not fair?
PANDARUS:
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay
behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her
the next time I see her. For my part, I'll meddle nor make no
more i' th' matter.
TROILUS:
Pandarus!
PANDARUS:
Not I.
TROILUS:
Sweet Pandarus!
PANDARUS:
Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all
as I found it, and there an end.
TROILUS:
Peace, you ungracious clamours! Peace, rude sounds!
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
I cannot fight upon this argument;
It is too starv'd a subject for my sword.
But Pandarus-O gods, how do you plague me!
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;
Between our Ilium and where she resides
Let it be call'd the wild and wand'ring flood;
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.
AENEAS:
How now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?
TROILUS:
Because not there. This woman's answer sorts,
For womanish it is to be from thence.
What news, Aeneas, from the field to-day?
AENEAS:
That Paris is returned home, and hurt.
TROILUS:
By whom, Aeneas?
AENEAS:
Troilus, by Menelaus.
TROILUS:
Let Paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
Paris is gor'd with Menelaus' horn.
AENEAS:
Hark what good sport is out of town to-day!
TROILUS:
Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
But to the sport abroad. Are you bound thither?
AENEAS:
In all swift haste.
TROILUS:
Come, go we then together.
CRESSIDA:
Who were those went by?
ALEXANDER:
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
CRESSIDA:
And whither go they?
ALEXANDER:
Up to the eastern tower,
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
Is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
He chid Andromache, and struck his armourer;
And, like as there were husbandry in war,
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
And to the field goes he; where every flower
Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
In Hector's wrath.
CRESSIDA:
What was his cause of anger?
ALEXANDER:
The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
They call him Ajax.
CRESSIDA:
Good; and what of him?
ALEXANDER:
They say he is a very man per se,
And stands alone.
CRESSIDA:
So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
legs.
ALEXANDER:
This man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
particular additions: he is as valiant as a lion, churlish as the
bear, slow as the elephant-a man into whom nature hath so crowded
humours that his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
it; he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he
hath the joints of every thing; but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind
Argus, all eyes and no sight.
CRESSIDA:
But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector
ALEXANDER:
They say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and
struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
kept Hector fasting and waking.
CRESSIDA:
Who comes here?
ALEXANDER:
Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
CRESSIDA:
Hector's a gallant man.
ALEXANDER:
As may be in the world, lady.
PANDARUS:
What's that? What's that?
CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
PANDARUS:
Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?- Good
morrow, Alexander.-How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?
CRESSIDA:
This morning, uncle.
PANDARUS:
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm'd
and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?
CRESSIDA:
Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.
PANDARUS:
E'en so. Hector was stirring early.
CRESSIDA:
That were we talking of, and of his anger.
PANDARUS:
Was he angry?
CRESSIDA:
So he says here.
PANDARUS:
True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about
him today, I can tell them that. And there's Troilus will not
come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell
them that too.
CRESSIDA:
What, is he angry too?
PANDARUS:
Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
CRESSIDA:
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
PANDARUS:
What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man
if you see him?
CRESSIDA:
Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
PANDARUS:
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
PANDARUS:
No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
CRESSIDA:
'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.
PANDARUS:
Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!
CRESSIDA:
So he is.
PANDARUS:
Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
CRESSIDA:
He is not Hector.
PANDARUS:
Himself! no, he's not himself. Would 'a were himself!
Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. Well, Troilus,
well! I would my heart were in her body! No, Hector is not a
better man than Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Excuse me.
PANDARUS:
He is elder.
CRESSIDA:
Pardon me, pardon me.
PANDARUS:
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have his wit this
year.
CRESSIDA:
He shall not need it if he have his own.
PANDARUS:
Nor his qualities.
CRESSIDA:
No matter.
PANDARUS:
Nor his beauty.
CRESSIDA:
'Twould not become him: his own's better.
PANDARUS:
YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th'
other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must
confess- not brown neither-
CRESSIDA:
No, but brown.
PANDARUS:
Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
CRESSIDA:
To say the truth, true and not true.
PANDARUS:
She prais'd his complexion above Paris.
CRESSIDA:
Why, Paris hath colour enough.
PANDARUS:
So he has.
CRESSIDA:
Then Troilus should have too much. If she prais'd him
above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended
Troilus for a copper nose.
PANDARUS:
I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
CRESSIDA:
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
PANDARUS:
Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day
into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
four hairs on his chin-
CRESSIDA:
Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total.
PANDARUS:
Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother Hector.
CRESSIDA:
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
PANDARUS:
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and
puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
CRESSIDA:
Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
PANDARUS:
Why, you know, 'tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes
him better than any man in all Phrygia.
CRESSIDA:
O, he smiles valiantly!
PANDARUS:
Does he not?
CRESSIDA:
O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
PANDARUS:
Why, go to, then! But to prove to you that Helen loves
Troilus-
CRESSIDA:
Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
PANDARUS:
Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an
addle egg.
CRESSIDA:
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
PANDARUS:
I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
chin. Indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, I must needs
confess.
CRESSIDA:
Without the rack.
PANDARUS:
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
CRESSIDA:
Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
PANDARUS:
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that
her eyes ran o'er.
CRESSIDA:
With millstones.
PANDARUS:
And Cassandra laugh'd.
CRESSIDA:
But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
eyes. Did her eyes run o'er too?
PANDARUS:
And Hector laugh'd.
CRESSIDA:
At what was all this laughing?
PANDARUS:
Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus'
chin.
CRESSIDA:
An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too.
PANDARUS:
They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
answer.
CRESSIDA:
What was his answer?
PANDARUS:
Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
and one of them is white.'
CRESSIDA:
This is her question.
PANDARUS:
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty
hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. That white hair is my father,
and all the rest are his sons.' 'Jupiter!' quoth she 'which of
these hairs is Paris my husband?' 'The forked one,' quoth he,
'pluck't out and give it him.' But there was such laughing! and
Helen so blush'd, and Paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
laugh'd that it pass'd.
CRESSIDA:
So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
PANDARUS:
Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
CRESSIDA:
So I do.
PANDARUS:
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
man born in April.
CRESSIDA:
And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
against May.
PANDARUS:
Hark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up
here and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do,
sweet niece Cressida.
CRESSIDA:
At your pleasure.
PANDARUS:
Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
most bravely. I'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
CRESSIDA:
Speak not so loud.
PANDARUS:
That's Aeneas. Is not that a brave man? He's one of the
flowers of Troy, I can tell you. But mark Troilus; you shall see
anon.
CRESSIDA:
Who's that?
PANDARUS:
That's Antenor. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and
he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
Troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. When comes Troilus?
I'll show you Troilus anon. If he see me, you shall see him nod
at me.
CRESSIDA:
Will he give you the nod?
PANDARUS:
You shall see.
CRESSIDA:
If he do, the rich shall have more.
PANDARUS:
That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man, niece. O brave
Hector! Look how he looks. There's a countenance! Is't not a
brave man?
CRESSIDA:
O, a brave man!
PANDARUS:
Is 'a not? It does a man's heart good. Look you what
hacks are on his helmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you
there. There's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who
will, as they say. There be hacks.
CRESSIDA:
Be those with swords?
PANDARUS:
Swords! anything, he cares not; an the devil come to him,
it's all one. By God's lid, it does one's heart good. Yonder
comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? Why,
this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home to-day? He's not
hurt. Why, this will do Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could
see Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
CRESSIDA:
Who's that?
PANDARUS:
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
CRESSIDA:
Can Helenus fight, uncle?
PANDARUS:
Helenus! no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I marvel
where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the people cry 'Troilus'?
Helenus is a priest.
CRESSIDA:
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
PANDARUS:
Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus. There's a
man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!
CRESSIDA:
Peace, for shame, peace!
PANDARUS:
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him,
niece; look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more
hack'd than Hector's; and how he looks, and how he goes! O
admirable youth! he never saw three and twenty. Go thy way,
Troilus, go thy way. Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a
goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris
is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an
eye to boot.
CRESSIDA:
Here comes more.
PANDARUS:
Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
porridge after meat! I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus.
Ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. Crows and daws,
crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
Agamemnon and all Greece.
CRESSIDA:
There is amongst the Greeks Achilles, a better man than
Troilus.
PANDARUS:
Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!
CRESSIDA:
Well, well.
PANDARUS:
Well, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any
eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good
shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth,
liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
CRESSIDA:
Ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in
the pie, for then the man's date is out.
PANDARUS:
You are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you
lie.
CRESSIDA:
Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend
my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to
defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these; and at all these
wards I lie at, at a thousand watches.
PANDARUS:
Say one of your watches.
CRESSIDA:
Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
chiefest of them too. If I cannot ward what I would not have hit,
I can watch you for telling how I took the blow; unless it swell
past hiding, and then it's past watching
PANDARUS:
You are such another!
BOY:
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
PANDARUS:
Where?
BOY:
At your own house; there he unarms him.
PANDARUS:
Good boy, tell him I come.
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
CRESSIDA:
Adieu, uncle.
PANDARUS:
I will be with you, niece, by and by.
CRESSIDA:
To bring, uncle.
PANDARUS:
Ay, a token from Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
By the same token, you are a bawd.
Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
He offers in another's enterprise;
But more in Troilus thousand-fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she belov'd knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is.
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue;
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
AGAMEMNON:
Princes,
What grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before,
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works
And call them shames, which are, indeed, nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove
To find persistive constancy in men;
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward,
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin.
But in the wind and tempest of her frown
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
And what hath mass or matter by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
NESTOR:
With due observance of thy godlike seat,
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth,
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Upon her patient breast, making their way
With those of nobler bulk!
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
Bounding between the two moist elements
Like Perseus' horse. Where's then the saucy boat,
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage
As rous'd with rage, with rage doth sympathise,
And with an accent tun'd in self-same key
Retorts to chiding fortune.
ULYSSES:
Agamemnon,
Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up-hear what Ulysses speaks.
Besides the applause and approbation
The which, most mighty, for thy place and sway,
I give to both your speeches- which were such
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass; and such again
As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
To his experienc'd tongue-yet let it please both,
Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
AGAMEMNON:
Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
That matter needless, of importless burden,
Divide thy lips than we are confident,
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.
ULYSSES:
Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
But for these instances:
The specialty of rule hath been neglected;
And look how many Grecian tents do stand
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
When that the general is not like the hive,
To whom the foragers shall all repair,
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,
Observe degree, priority, and place,
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
Office, and custom, in all line of order;
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd
Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
And posts, like the commandment of a king,
Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets
In evil mixture to disorder wander,
What plagues and what portents, what mutiny,
What raging of the sea, shaking of earth,
Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors,
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,
The unity and married calm of states
Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shak'd,
Which is the ladder of all high designs,
The enterprise is sick! How could communities,
Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
The primogenity and due of birth,
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
But by degree, stand in authentic place?
Take but degree away, untune that string,
And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,
And make a sop of all this solid globe;
Strength should be lord of imbecility,
And the rude son should strike his father dead;
Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong-
Between whose endless jar justice resides-
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
Then everything includes itself in power,
Power into will, will into appetite;
And appetite, an universal wolf,
So doubly seconded with will and power,
Must make perforce an universal prey,
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
Follows the choking.
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
By him one step below, he by the next,
That next by him beneath; so ever step,
Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation.
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
NESTOR:
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
The fever whereof all our power is sick.
AGAMEMNON:
The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
What is the remedy?
ULYSSES:
The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs; with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests;
And with ridiculous and awkward action-
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls-
He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
Thy topless deputation he puts on;
And like a strutting player whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd,
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
As he being drest to some oration.'
That's done-as near as the extremest ends
Of parallels, as like Vulcan and his wife;
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Severals and generals of grace exact,
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Excitements to the field or speech for truce,
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
NESTOR:
And in the imitation of these twain-
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
With an imperial voice-many are infect.
Ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
In such a rein, in full as proud a place
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
To match us in comparisons with dirt,
To weaken and discredit our exposure,
How rank soever rounded in with danger.
ULYSSES:
They tax our policy and call it cowardice,
Count wisdom as no member of the war,
Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
But that of hand. The still and mental parts
That do contrive how many hands shall strike
When fitness calls them on, and know, by measure
Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight-
Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
They call this bed-work, mapp'ry, closet-war;
So that the ram that batters down the wall,
For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
They place before his hand that made the engine,
Or those that with the fineness of their souls
By reason guide his execution.
NESTOR:
Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
Makes many Thetis' sons.
AGAMEMNON:
What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.
MENELAUS:
From Troy.
AGAMEMNON:
What would you fore our tent?
AENEAS:
Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
AGAMEMNON:
Even this.
AENEAS:
May one that is a herald and a prince
Do a fair message to his kingly eyes?
AGAMEMNON:
With surety stronger than Achilles' an
Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general.
AENEAS:
Fair leave and large security. How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals?
AGAMEMNON:
How?
AENEAS:
Ay;
I ask, that I might waken reverence,
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as Morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus.
Which is that god in office, guiding men?
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
AGAMEMNON:
This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers.
AENEAS:
Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace.
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove's accord,
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,
Peace, Troyan; lay thy finger on thy lips.
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
If that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth;
But what the repining enemy commends,
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.
AGAMEMNON:
Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
AENEAS:
Ay, Greek, that is my name.
AGAMEMNON:
What's your affair, I pray you?
AENEAS:
Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
AGAMEMNON:
He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
AENEAS:
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him;
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
To set his sense on the attentive bent,
And then to speak.
AGAMEMNON:
Speak frankly as the wind;
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour.
That thou shalt know, Troyan, he is awake,
He tells thee so himself.
AENEAS:
Trumpet, blow loud,
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
And every Greek of mettle, let him know
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Is resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet
And to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
That holds his honour higher than his ease,
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
That knows his valour and knows not his fear,
That loves his mistress more than in confession
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
In other arms than hers-to him this challenge.
Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,
Shall make it good or do his best to do it:
He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer,
Than ever Greek did couple in his arms;
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Mid-way between your tents and walls of Troy
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.
If any come, Hector shall honour him;
If none, he'll say in Troy, when he retires,
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
AGAMEMNON:
This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
If none of them have soul in such a kind,
We left them all at home. But we are soldiers;
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
That means not, hath not, or is not in love.
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
NESTOR:
Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
When Hector's grandsire suck'd. He is old now;
But if there be not in our Grecian mould
One noble man that hath one spark of fire
To answer for his love, tell him from me
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady
Was fairer than his grandame, and as chaste
As may be in the world. His youth in flood,
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
AENEAS:
Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!
ULYSSES:
Amen.
AGAMEMNON:
Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;
To our pavilion shall I lead you, first.
Achilles shall have word of this intent;
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.
Yourself shall feast with us before you go,
And find the welcome of a noble foe.
ULYSSES:
Nestor!
NESTOR:
What says Ulysses?
ULYSSES:
I have a young conception in my brain;
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
NESTOR:
What is't?
ULYSSES:
This 'tis:
Blunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
To overbulk us all.
NESTOR:
Well, and how?
ULYSSES:
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
However it is spread in general name,
Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
NESTOR:
True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance
Whose grossness little characters sum up;
And, in the publication, make no strain
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
As banks of Libya-though, Apollo knows,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
Pointing on him.
ULYSSES:
And wake him to the answer, think you?
NESTOR:
Why, 'tis most meet. Who may you else oppose
That can from Hector bring those honours off,
If not Achilles? Though 't be a sportful combat,
Yet in this trial much opinion dwells;
For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute
With their fin'st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,
Our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
In this vile action; for the success,
Although particular, shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general;
And in such indexes, although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mas
Of things to come at large. It is suppos'd
He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
As 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
What heart receives from hence a conquering part,
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs.
ULYSSES:
Give pardon to my speech.
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares
And think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre
Of the better yet to show shall show the better,
By showing the worst first. Do not consent
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
For both our honour and our shame in this
Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
NESTOR:
I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?
ULYSSES:
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
Were he not proud, we all should wear with him;
But he already is too insolent;
And it were better parch in Afric sun
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil'd,
Why, then we do our main opinion crush
In taint of our best man. No, make a lott'ry;
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man;
For that will physic the great Myrmidon,
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
His crest, that prouder than blue Iris bends.
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
We'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
Yet go we under our opinion still
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes-
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
NESTOR:
Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice;
And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
AJAX:
Thersites!
THERSITES:
Agamemnon-how if he had boils full, an over, generally?
AJAX:
Thersites!
THERSITES:
And those boils did run-say so. Did not the general run
then? Were not that a botchy core?
AJAX:
Dog!
THERSITES:
Then there would come some matter from him;
I see none now.
AJAX:
Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear? Feel, then.
THERSITES:
The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted
lord!
AJAX:
Speak, then, thou whinid'st leaven, speak. I will beat thee
into handsomeness.
THERSITES:
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness; but I
think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a
prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst thou? A red murrain
o' thy jade's tricks!
AJAX:
Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
THERSITES:
Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
AJAX:
The proclamation!
THERSITES:
Thou art proclaim'd, a fool, I think.
AJAX:
Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
THERSITES:
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the
scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in
Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as
slow as another.
AJAX:
I say, the proclamation.
THERSITES:
Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles; and
thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at
Proserpina's beauty-ay, that thou bark'st at him.
AJAX:
Mistress Thersites!
THERSITES:
Thou shouldst strike him.
AJAX:
Cobloaf!
THERSITES:
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
sailor breaks a biscuit.
AJAX:
You whoreson cur!
THERSITES:
Do, do.
AJAX:
Thou stool for a witch!
THERSITES:
Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more
brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinico may tutor thee. You
scurvy valiant ass! Thou art here but to thrash Troyans, and thou
art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian
slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell
what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou!
AJAX:
You dog!
THERSITES:
You scurvy lord!
AJAX:
You cur!
THERSITES:
Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
ACHILLES:
Why, how now, Ajax! Wherefore do you thus?
How now, Thersites! What's the matter, man?
THERSITES:
You see him there, do you?
ACHILLES:
Ay; what's the matter?
THERSITES:
Nay, look upon him.
ACHILLES:
So I do. What's the matter?
THERSITES:
Nay, but regard him well.
ACHILLES:
Well! why, so I do.
THERSITES:
But yet you look not well upon him; for who some ever
you take him to be, he is Ajax.
ACHILLES:
I know that, fool.
THERSITES:
Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
AJAX:
Therefore I beat thee.
THERSITES:
Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His
evasions have ears thus long. I have bobb'd his brain more than
he has beat my bones. I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and
his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow. This
lord, Achilles, Ajax-who wears his wit in his belly and his guts
in his head-I'll tell you what I say of him.
ACHILLES:
What?
THERSITES:
I say this Ajax-
ACHILLES:
Nay, good Ajax.
THERSITES:
Has not so much wit-
ACHILLES:
Nay, I must hold you.
THERSITES:
As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
comes to fight.
ACHILLES:
Peace, fool.
THERSITES:
I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not-
he there; that he; look you there.
AJAX:
O thou damned cur! I shall-
ACHILLES:
Will you set your wit to a fool's?
THERSITES:
No, I warrant you, the fool's will shame it.
PATROCLUS:
Good words, Thersites.
ACHILLES:
What's the quarrel?
AJAX:
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the
proclamation, and he rails upon me.
THERSITES:
I serve thee not.
AJAX:
Well, go to, go to.
THERSITES:
I serve here voluntary.
ACHILLES:
Your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not voluntary. No
man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was here the voluntary, and you as
under an impress.
THERSITES:
E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your
sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a great catch
an he knock out either of your brains: 'a were as good crack a
fusty nut with no kernel.
ACHILLES:
What, with me too, Thersites?
THERSITES:
There's Ulysses and old Nestor-whose wit was mouldy ere
your grandsires had nails on their toes-yoke you like draught
oxen, and make you plough up the wars.
ACHILLES:
What, what?
THERSITES:
Yes, good sooth. To Achilles, to Ajax, to-
AJAX:
I shall cut out your tongue.
THERSITES:
'Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou
afterwards.
PATROCLUS:
No more words, Thersites; peace!
THERSITES:
I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall
I?
ACHILLES:
There's for you, Patroclus.
THERSITES:
I will see you hang'd like clotpoles ere I come any more
to your tents. I will keep where there is wit stirring, and leave
the faction of fools.
PATROCLUS:
A good riddance.
ACHILLES:
Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host,
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy,
To-morrow morning, call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
Maintain I know not what; 'tis trash. Farewell.
AJAX:
Farewell. Who shall answer him?
ACHILLES:
I know not; 'tis put to lott'ry. Otherwise. He knew his
man.
AJAX:
O, meaning you! I will go learn more of it.
PRIAM:
After so many hours, lives, speeches, spent,
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
'Deliver Helen, and all damage else-
As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum'd
In hot digestion of this cormorant war-
Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
HECTOR:
Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I,
As far as toucheth my particular,
Yet, dread Priam,
There is no lady of more softer bowels,
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
To th' bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Every tithe soul 'mongst many thousand dismes
Hath been as dear as Helen-I mean, of ours.
If we have lost so many tenths of ours
To guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us,
Had it our name, the value of one ten,
What merit's in that reason which denies
The yielding of her up?
TROILUS:
Fie, fie, my brother!
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king,
So great as our dread father's, in a scale
Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum
The past-proportion of his infinite,
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
With spans and inches so diminutive
As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!
HELENUS:
No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
You are so empty of them. Should not our father
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
TROILUS:
You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:
You know an enemy intends you harm;
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
And reason flies the object of all harm.
Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
Let's shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honour
Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts
With this cramm'd reason. Reason and respect
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
HECTOR:
Brother, she is not worth what she doth, cost
The keeping.
TROILUS:
What's aught but as 'tis valued?
HECTOR:
But value dwells not in particular will:
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
As in the prizer. 'Tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god-I
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects,
Without some image of th' affected merit.
TROILUS:
I take to-day a wife, and my election
Is led on in the conduct of my will;
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
Although my will distaste what it elected,
The wife I chose? There can be no evasion
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour.
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
When we have soil'd them; nor the remainder viands
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks;
Your breath with full consent benied his sails;
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,
And did him service. He touch'd the ports desir'd;
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went-
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go'-
If you'll confess he brought home worthy prize-
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands,
And cried 'Inestimable!' -why do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
And do a deed that never fortune did-
Beggar the estimation which you priz'd
Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n
That in their country did them that disgrace
We fear to warrant in our native place!
CASSANDRA:
[Within] Cry, Troyans, cry.
PRIAM:
What noise, what shriek is this?
TROILUS:
'Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.
CASSANDRA:
[Within] Cry, Troyans.
HECTOR:
It is Cassandra.
CASSANDRA:
Cry, Troyans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes,
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
HECTOR:
Peace, sister, peace.
CASSANDRA:
Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
Add to my clamours. Let us pay betimes
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
Cry, Troyans, cry. Practise your eyes with tears.
Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
Cry, Troyans, cry, A Helen and a woe!
Cry, cry. Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
HECTOR:
Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse, or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
Can qualify the same?
TROILUS:
Why, brother Hector,
We may not think the justness of each act
Such and no other than event doth form it;
Nor once deject the courage of our minds
Because Cassandra's mad. Her brain-sick raptures
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Which hath our several honours all engag'd
To make it gracious. For my private part,
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons;
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
To fight for and maintain.
PARIS:
Else might the world convince of levity
As well my undertakings as your counsels;
But I attest the gods, your full consent
Gave wings to my propension, and cut of
All fears attending on so dire a project.
For what, alas, can these my single arms?
What propugnation is in one man's valour
To stand the push and enmity of those
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
Were I alone to pass the difficulties,
And had as ample power as I have will,
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done
Nor faint in the pursuit.
PRIAM:
Paris, you speak
Like one besotted on your sweet delights.
You have the honey still, but these the gall;
So to be valiant is no praise at all.
PARIS:
Sir, I propose not merely to myself
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Wip'd off in honourable keeping her.
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended; nor none so noble
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say,
Well may we fight for her whom we know well
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
HECTOR:
Paris and Troilus, you have both said well;
And on the cause and question now in hand
Have gloz'd, but superficially; not much
Unlike young men, whom Aristode thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemp'red blood
Than to make up a free determination
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision. Nature craves
All dues be rend'red to their owners. Now,
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection;
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills, resist the same;
There is a law in each well-order'd nation
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory.
If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta's king-
As it is known she is-these moral laws
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back return'd. Thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
Is this, in way of truth. Yet, ne'er the less,
My spritely brethren, I propend to you
In resolution to keep Helen still;
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
Upon our joint and several dignities.
TROILUS:
Why, there you touch'd the life of our design.
Were it not glory that we more affected
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood
Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
She is a theme of honour and renown,
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
And fame in time to come canonize us;
For I presume brave Hector would not lose
So rich advantage of a promis'd glory
As smiles upon the forehead of this action
For the wide world's revenue.
HECTOR:
I am yours,
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.
I was advertis'd their great general slept,
Whilst emulation in the army crept.
This, I presume, will wake him.
THERSITES:
How now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy
fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I
rail at him. O worthy satisfaction! Would it were otherwise: that
I could beat him, whilst he rail'd at me! 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of my spiteful
execrations. Then there's Achilles, a rare engineer! If Troy be
not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till
they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose
all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that
little little less-than-little wit from them that they have!
which short-arm'd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce,
it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without
drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the
vengeance on the whole camp! or, rather, the Neapolitan
bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the curse depending on those
that war for a placket. I have said my prayers; and devil Envy
say 'Amen.' What ho! my Lord Achilles!
PATROCLUS:
Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and
rail.
THERSITES:
If I could 'a rememb'red a gilt counterfeit, thou
wouldst not have slipp'd out of my contemplation; but it is no
matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly
and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from
a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death. Then if she that lays thee out says
thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never
shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where's Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?
THERSITES:
Ay, the heavens hear me!
PATROCLUS:
Amen.
ACHILLES:
Who's there?
PATROCLUS:
Thersites, my lord.
ACHILLES:
Where, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so
many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
THERSITES:
Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what's
Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what's
Thersites?
THERSITES:
Thy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art
thou?
PATROCLUS:
Thou must tell that knowest.
ACHILLES:
O, tell, tell,
THERSITES:
I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus' knower; and
Patroclus is a fool.
PATROCLUS:
You rascal!
THERSITES:
Peace, fool! I have not done.
ACHILLES:
He is a privileg'd man. Proceed, Thersites.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a
fool; and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
ACHILLES:
Derive this; come.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a
fool to serve such a fool; and this Patroclus is a fool positive.
PATROCLUS:
Why am I a fool?
THERSITES:
Make that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou
art. Look you, who comes here?
ACHILLES:
Come, Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody. Come in with me,
Thersites.
THERSITES:
Here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery.
All the argument is a whore and a cuckold-a good quarrel to draw
emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on
the subject, and war and lechery confound all!
AGAMEMNON:
Where is Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
AGAMEMNON:
Let it be known to him that we are here.
He shent our messengers; and we lay by
Our appertainings, visiting of him.
Let him be told so; lest, perchance, he think
We dare not move the question of our place
Or know not what we are.
PATROCLUS:
I shall say so to him.
ULYSSES:
We saw him at the opening of his tent.
He is not sick.
AJAX:
Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it
melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head, 'tis
pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.
NESTOR:
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
ULYSSES:
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
NESTOR:
Who, Thersites?
ULYSSES:
He.
NESTOR:
Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument
ULYSSES:
No; you see he is his argument that has his argument-
Achilles.
NESTOR:
All the better; their fraction is more our wish than their
faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite!
ULYSSES:
The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.
Here comes Patroclus.
NESTOR:
No Achilles with him.
ULYSSES:
The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs
are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
PATROCLUS:
Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
But for your health and your digestion sake,
An after-dinner's breath.
AGAMEMNON:
Hear you, Patroclus.
We are too well acquainted with these answers;
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues,
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss;
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin
If you do say we think him over-proud
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance; yea, watch
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and ad
That if he overhold his price so much
We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine
Not portable, lie under this report:
Bring action hither; this cannot go to war.
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.
PATROCLUS:
I shall, and bring his answer presently.
AGAMEMNON:
In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
AJAX:
What is he more than another?
AGAMEMNON:
No more than what he thinks he is.
AJAX:
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better
man than I am?
AGAMEMNON:
No question.
AJAX:
Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?
AGAMEMNON:
No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,
no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.
AJAX:
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not
what pride is.
AGAMEMNON:
Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass,
his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself
but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.
AJAX:
I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
NESTOR:
[Aside] And yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
ULYSSES:
Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
AGAMEMNON:
What's his excuse?
ULYSSES:
He doth rely on none;
But carries on the stream of his dispose,
Without observance or respect of any,
In will peculiar and in self-admission.
AGAMEMNON:
Why will he not, upon our fair request,
Untent his person and share the air with us?
ULYSSES:
Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
He makes important; possess'd he is with greatness,
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
That quarrels at self-breath. Imagin'd worth
Holds in his blood such swol'n and hot discourse
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages,
And batters down himself. What should I say?
He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
Cry 'No recovery.'
AGAMEMNON:
Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
At your request a little from himself.
ULYSSES:
O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve
And ruminate himself-shall he be worshipp'd
Of that we hold an idol more than he?
No, this thrice-worthy and right valiant lord
Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir'd,
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
As amply titled as Achilles is,
By going to Achilles.
That were to enlard his fat-already pride,
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion.
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
NESTOR:
[Aside] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.
DIOMEDES:
[Aside] And how his silence drinks up this applause!
AJAX:
If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the
face.
AGAMEMNON:
O, no, you shall not go.
AJAX:
An 'a be proud with me I'll pheeze his pride.
Let me go to him.
ULYSSES:
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
AJAX:
A paltry, insolent fellow!
NESTOR:
[Aside] How he describes himself!
AJAX:
Can he not be sociable?
ULYSSES:
[Aside] The raven chides blackness.
AJAX:
I'll let his humours blood.
AGAMEMNON:
[Aside] He will be the physician that should be the
patient.
AJAX:
An all men were a my mind-
ULYSSES:
[Aside] Wit would be out of fashion.
AJAX:
'A should not bear it so, 'a should eat's words first.
Shall pride carry it?
NESTOR:
[Aside] An 'twould, you'd carry half.
ULYSSES:
[Aside] 'A would have ten shares.
AJAX:
I will knead him, I'll make him supple.
NESTOR:
[Aside] He's not yet through warm. Force him with praises;
pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
ULYSSES:
[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
NESTOR:
Our noble general, do not do so.
DIOMEDES:
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
ULYSSES:
Why 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
Here is a man-but 'tis before his face;
I will be silent.
NESTOR:
Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
ULYSSES:
Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
AJAX:
A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus!
Would he were a Troyan!
NESTOR:
What a vice were it in Ajax now-
ULYSSES:
If he were proud.
DIOMEDES:
Or covetous of praise.
ULYSSES:
Ay, or surly borne.
DIOMEDES:
Or strange, or self-affected.
ULYSSES:
Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure
Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck;
Fam'd be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
Thrice-fam'd beyond, beyond all erudition;
But he that disciplin'd thine arms to fight-
Let Mars divide eternity in twain
And give him half; and, for thy vigour,
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here's Nestor,
Instructed by the antiquary times-
He must, he is, he cannot but be wise;
But pardon, father Nestor, were your days
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
You should not have the eminence of him,
But be as Ajax.
AJAX:
Shall I call you father?
NESTOR:
Ay, my good son.
DIOMEDES:
Be rul'd by him, Lord Ajax.
ULYSSES:
There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
To call together all his state of war;
Fresh kings are come to Troy. To-morrow
We must with all our main of power stand fast;
And here's a lord-come knights from east to west
And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
AGAMEMNON:
Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.
Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
Exeunt
PANDARUS:
Friend, you-pray you, a word. Do you not follow the young
Lord Paris?
SERVANT:
Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
PANDARUS:
You depend upon him, I mean?
SERVANT:
Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
PANDARUS:
You depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise
him.
SERVANT:
The lord be praised!
PANDARUS:
You know me, do you not?
SERVANT:
Faith, sir, superficially.
PANDARUS:
Friend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.
SERVANT:
I hope I shall know your honour better.
PANDARUS:
I do desire it.
SERVANT:
You are in the state of grace.
PANDARUS:
Grace! Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles.
What music is this?
SERVANT:
I do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.
PANDARUS:
Know you the musicians?
SERVANT:
Wholly, sir.
PANDARUS:
Who play they to?
SERVANT:
To the hearers, sir.
PANDARUS:
At whose pleasure, friend?
SERVANT:
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
PANDARUS:
Command, I mean, friend.
SERVANT:
Who shall I command, sir?
PANDARUS:
Friend, we understand not one another: I am to courtly,
and thou art too cunning. At whose request do these men play?
SERVANT:
That's to't, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of
Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus,
the heart-blood of beauty, love's invisible soul-
PANDARUS:
Who, my cousin, Cressida?
SERVANT:
No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her
attributes?
PANDARUS:
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady
Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I
will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business
seethes.
SERVANT:
Sodden business! There's a stew'd phrase indeed!
PANDARUS:
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company!
Fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them- especially
to you, fair queen! Fair thoughts be your fair pillow.
HELEN:
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
PANDARUS:
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince,
here is good broken music.
PARIS:
You have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it
whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your
performance.
HELEN:
He is full of harmony.
PANDARUS:
Truly, lady, no.
HELEN:
O, sir-
PANDARUS:
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
PARIS:
Well said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.
PANDARUS:
I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you
vouchsafe me a word?
HELEN:
Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you sing,
certainly-
PANDARUS:
Well sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry,
thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your
brother Troilus-
HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord-
PANDARUS:
Go to, sweet queen, go to-commends himself most
affectionately to you-
HELEN:
You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our
melancholy upon your head!
PANDARUS:
Sweet queen, sweet queen; that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
HELEN:
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
PANDARUS:
Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not,
in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no. -And, my
lord, he desires you that, if the King call for him at supper,
you will make his excuse.
HELEN:
My Lord Pandarus!
PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
PARIS:
What exploit's in hand? Where sups he to-night?
HELEN:
Nay, but, my lord-
PANDARUS:
What says my sweet queen?-My cousin will fall out with
you.
HELEN:
You must not know where he sups.
PARIS:
I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
PANDARUS:
No, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer
is sick.
PARIS:
Well, I'll make's excuse.
PANDARUS:
Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?
No, your poor disposer's sick.
PARIS:
I spy.
PANDARUS:
You spy! What do you spy?-Come, give me an instrument.
Now, sweet queen.
HELEN:
Why, this is kindly done.
PANDARUS:
My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet
queen.
HELEN:
She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.
PANDARUS:
He! No, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
HELEN:
Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
PANDARUS:
Come, come. I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing you a
song now.
HELEN:
Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a
fine forehead.
PANDARUS:
Ay, you may, you may.
HELEN:
Let thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid,
Cupid, Cupid!
PANDARUS:
Love! Ay, that it shall, i' faith.
PARIS:
Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
PANDARUS:
In good troth, it begins so.
Love, love, nothing but love, still love, still more!
But tickles still the sore.
These lovers cry, O ho, they die!
Doth turn O ho! to ha! ha! he!
O ho! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
O ho! groans out for ha! ha! ha!-hey ho!
HELEN:
In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
PARIS:
He eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot
deeds, and hot deeds is love.
PANDARUS:
Is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers. Is love a generation of
vipers? Sweet lord, who's a-field today?
PARIS:
Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry
of Troy. I would fain have arm'd to-day, but my Nell would not
have it so. How chance my brother Troilus went not?
HELEN:
He hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.
PANDARUS:
Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend
to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
PARIS:
To a hair.
PANDARUS:
Farewell, sweet queen.
HELEN:
Commend me to your niece.
PANDARUS:
I will, sweet queen.
PARIS:
They're come from the field. Let us to Priam's hall
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector. His stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
Than all the island kings-disarm great Hector.
HELEN:
'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
Yea, overshines ourself.
PARIS:
Sweet, above thought I love thee.
PANDARUS:
How now! Where's thy master? At my cousin Cressida's?
BOY:
No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
PANDARUS:
O, here he comes. How now, how now!
TROILUS:
Sirrah, walk off.
PANDARUS:
Have you seen my cousin?
TROILUS:
No, Pandarus. I stalk about her door
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
And give me swift transportance to these fields
Where I may wallow in the lily beds
Propos'd for the deserver! O gentle Pandar,
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,
And fly with me to Cressid!
PANDARUS:
Walk here i' th' orchard, I'll bring her straight.
TROILUS:
I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
Th' imaginary relish is so sweet
That it enchants my sense; what will it be
When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed
Love's thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;
Swooning destruction; or some joy too fine,
Too subtle-potent, tun'd too sharp in sweetness,
For the capacity of my ruder powers.
I fear it much; and I do fear besides
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying.
PANDARUS:
She's making her ready, she'll come straight; you must be
witty now. She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as
if she were fray'd with a sprite. I'll fetch her. It is the
prettiest villain; she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en
sparrow.
TROILUS:
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom.
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse,
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring
The eye of majesty.
PANDARUS:
Come, come, what need you blush? Shame's a baby.-Here she
is now; swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.-
What, are you gone again? You must be watch'd ere you be made
tame, must you? Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw
backward, we'll put you i' th' fills.-Why do you not speak to
her?-Come, draw this curtain and let's see your picture.
Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! An 'twere
dark, you'd close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress
How now, a kiss in fee-farm! Build there, carpenter; the air is
sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The
falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' th' river. Go to, go
to.
TROILUS:
You have bereft me of all words, lady.
PANDARUS:
Words pay no debts, give her deeds; but she'll bereave
you o' th' deeds too, if she call your activity in question.
What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof the parties
interchangeably.' Come in, come in; I'll go get a fire.
CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?
TROILUS:
O Cressid, how often have I wish'd me thus!
CRESSIDA:
Wish'd, my lord! The gods grant-O my lord!
TROILUS:
What should they grant? What makes this pretty abruption?
What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our
love?
CRESSIDA:
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
TROILUS:
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
CRESSIDA:
Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing
than blind reason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft
cures the worse.
TROILUS:
O, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid's pageant
there is presented no monster.
CRESSIDA:
Nor nothing monstrous neither?
TROILUS:
Nothing, but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas,
live in fire, cat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our
mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any
difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that
the will is infinite, and the execution confin'd; that the desire
is boundless, and the act a slave to limit.
CRESSIDA:
They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing
more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the
tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act
of hares, are they not monsters?
TROILUS:
Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are
tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go bare till merit
crown it. No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in
present. We will not name desert before his birth; and, being
born, his addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith:
Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall
be a mock for his truth; and what truth can speak truest not
truer than Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Will you walk in, my lord?
PANDARUS:
What, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?
CRESSIDA:
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
PANDARUS:
I thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you'll
give him me. Be true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.
TROILUS:
You know now your hostages: your uncle's word and my firm
faith.
PANDARUS:
Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred, though
they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won;
they are burs, I can tell you; they'll stick where they are
thrown.
CRESSIDA:
Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart.
Prince Troilus, I have lov'd you night and day
For many weary months.
TROILUS:
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
CRESSIDA:
Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,
With the first glance that ever-pardon me.
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
I love you now; but till now not so much
But I might master it. In faith, I lie;
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabb'd? Who shall be true to us,
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But, though I lov'd you well, I woo'd you not;
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel. Stop my mouth.
TROILUS:
And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
PANDARUS:
Pretty, i' faith.
CRESSIDA:
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
I am asham'd. O heavens! what have I done?
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
TROILUS:
Your leave, sweet Cressid!
PANDARUS:
Leave! An you take leave till to-morrow morning-
CRESSIDA:
Pray you, content you.
TROILUS:
What offends you, lady?
CRESSIDA:
Sir, mine own company.
TROILUS:
You cannot shun yourself.
CRESSIDA:
Let me go and try.
I have a kind of self resides with you;
But an unkind self, that itself will leave
To be another's fool. I would be gone.
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
TROILUS:
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
CRESSIDA:
Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
And fell so roundly to a large confession
To angle for your thoughts; but you are wise-
Or else you love not; for to be wise and love
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
TROILUS:
O that I thought it could be in a woman-
As, if it can, I will presume in you-
To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnowed purity in love.
How were I then uplifted! but, alas,
I am as true as truth's simplicity,
And simpler than the infancy of truth.
CRESSIDA:
In that I'll war with you.
TROILUS:
O virtuous fight,
When right with right wars who shall be most right!
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truth by Troilus, when their rhymes,
Full of protest, of oath, and big compare,
Want similes, truth tir'd with iteration-
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as earth to th' centre-
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
As truth's authentic author to be cited,
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse
And sanctify the numbers.
CRESSIDA:
Prophet may you be!
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
When time is old and hath forgot itself,
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
And mighty states characterless are grated
To dusty nothing-yet let memory
From false to false, among false maids in love,
Upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'As false
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
As fox to lamb, or wolf to heifer's calf,
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son'-
Yea, let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
'As false as Cressid.'
PANDARUS:
Go to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I'll be the
witness. Here I hold your hand; here my cousin's. If ever you
prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to
bring you together, let all pitiful goers- between be call'd to
the world's end after my name-call them all Pandars; let all
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all
brokers between Pandars. Say 'Amen.'
TROILUS:
Amen.
CRESSIDA:
Amen.
PANDARUS:
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber
and a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,
Bed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!
CALCHAS:
Now, Princes, for the service I have done,
Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That, through the sight I bear in things to come,
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
Incurr'd a traitor's name, expos'd myself
From certain and possess'd conveniences
To doubtful fortunes, sequest'ring from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,
Made tame and most familiar to my nature;
And here, to do you service, am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted-
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit
Out of those many regist'red in promise,
Which you say live to come in my behalf.
AGAMEMNON:
What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.
CALCHAS:
You have a Troyan prisoner call'd Antenor,
Yesterday took; Troy holds him very dear.
Oft have you-often have you thanks therefore-
Desir'd my Cressid in right great exchange,
Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack
Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
In change of him. Let him be sent, great Princes,
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done
In most accepted pain.
AGAMEMNON:
Let Diomedes bear him,
And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Furnish you fairly for this interchange;
Withal, bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge. Ajax is ready.
DIOMEDES:
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.
ULYSSES:
Achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent.
Please it our general pass strangely by him,
As if he were forgot; and, Princes all,
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn'd on him?
If so, I have derision med'cinable
To use between your strangeness and his pride,
Which his own will shall have desire to drink.
It may do good. Pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride; for supple knees
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
AGAMEMNON:
We'll execute your purpose, and put on
A form of strangeness as we pass along.
So do each lord; and either greet him not,
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
ACHILLES:
What comes the general to speak with me?
You know my mind. I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
AGAMEMNON:
What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?
NESTOR:
Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
ACHILLES:
No.
NESTOR:
Nothing, my lord.
AGAMEMNON:
The better.
ACHILLES:
Good day, good day.
MENELAUS:
How do you? How do you?
ACHILLES:
What, does the cuckold scorn me?
AJAX:
How now, Patroclus?
ACHILLES:
Good morrow, Ajax.
AJAX:
Ha?
ACHILLES:
Good morrow.
AJAX:
Ay, and good next day too.
ACHILLES:
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
PATROCLUS:
They pass by strangely. They were us'd to bend,
To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
To come as humbly as they us'd to creep
To holy altars.
ACHILLES:
What, am I poor of late?
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
Must fall out with men too. What the declin'd is,
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer;
And not a man for being simply man
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
That are without him, as place, riches, and favour,
Prizes of accident, as oft as merit;
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
Doth one pluck down another, and together
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends; I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.
I'll interrupt his reading.
How now, Ulysses!
ULYSSES:
Now, great Thetis' son!
ACHILLES:
What are you reading?
ULYSSES:
A strange fellow here
Writes me that man-how dearly ever parted,
How much in having, or without or in-
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them, and they retort that heat again
To the first giver.
ACHILLES:
This is not strange, Ulysses.
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not, but commends itself
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself-
That most pure spirit of sense-behold itself,
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
Salutes each other with each other's form;
For speculation turns not to itself
Till it hath travell'd, and is mirror'd there
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
ULYSSES:
I do not strain at the position-
It is familiar-but at the author's drift;
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
That no man is the lord of anything,
Though in and of him there be much consisting,
Till he communicate his parts to others;
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them formed in th' applause
Where th' are extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate
The voice again; or, like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this;
And apprehended here immediately
Th' unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!
A very horse that has he knows not what!
Nature, what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow-
An act that very chance doth throw upon him-
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
While some men leave to do!
How some men creep in skittish Fortune's-hall,
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
How one man eats into another's pride,
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
To see these Grecian lords!-why, even already
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast,
And great Troy shrinking.
ACHILLES:
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
As misers do by beggars-neither gave to me
Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?
ULYSSES:
Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright. To have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way;
For honour travels in a strait so narrow -
Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue; if you give way,
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Like to an ent'red tide they all rush by
And leave you hindmost;
Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
O'er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
For Time is like a fashionable host,
That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand;
And with his arms out-stretch'd, as he would fly,
Grasps in the corner. The welcome ever smiles,
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;
For beauty, wit,
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
To envious and calumniating Time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin-
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
And give to dust that is a little gilt
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object.
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,
And still it might, and yet it may again,
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent,
Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves,
And drave great Mars to faction.
ACHILLES:
Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons.
ULYSSES:
But 'gainst your privacy
The reasons are more potent and heroical.
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
With one of Priam's daughters.
ACHILLES:
Ha! known!
ULYSSES:
Is that a wonder?
The providence that's in a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold;
Finds bottom in th' uncomprehensive deeps;
Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,
Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
There is a mystery-with whom relation
Durst never meddle-in the soul of state,
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to.
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena.
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
When fame shall in our island sound her trump,
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win;
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
PATROCLUS:
To this effect, Achilles, have I mov'd you.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus.
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
Be shook to airy air.
ACHILLES:
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
PATROCLUS:
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
ACHILLES:
I see my reputation is at stake;
My fame is shrewdly gor'd.
PATROCLUS:
O, then, beware:
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves;
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Even then when they sit idly in the sun.
ACHILLES:
Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
I'll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him
T' invite the Troyan lords, after the combat,
To see us here unarm'd. I have a woman's longing,
An appetite that I am sick withal,
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace;
To talk with him, and to behold his visage,
Even to my full of view.
A labour sav'd!
THERSITES:
A wonder!
ACHILLES:
What?
THERSITES:
Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself.
ACHILLES:
How so?
THERSITES:
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in
saying nothing.
ACHILLES:
How can that be?
THERSITES:
Why, 'a stalks up and down like a peacock-a stride and a
stand; ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her
brain to set down her reckoning, bites his lip with a politic
regard, as who should say 'There were wit in this head, an
'twould out'; and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as
fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man's
undone for ever; for if Hector break not his neck i' th' combat,
he'll break't himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said 'Good
morrow, Ajax'; and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think you
of this man that takes me for the general? He's grown a very land
fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may
wear it on both sides, like leather jerkin.
ACHILLES:
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
THERSITES:
Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
answering. Speaking is for beggars: he wears his tongue in's
arms. I will put on his presence. Let Patroclus make his demands
to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.
ACHILLES:
To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant
Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm'd to my
tent; and to procure safe conduct for his person of the
magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honour'd
Captain General of the Grecian army, et cetera, Agamemnon. Do
this.
PATROCLUS:
Jove bless great Ajax!
THERSITES:
Hum!
PATROCLUS:
I come from the worthy Achilles-
THERSITES:
Ha!
PATROCLUS:
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his
tent-
THERSITES:
Hum!
PATROCLUS:
And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.
THERSITES:
Agamemnon!
PATROCLUS:
Ay, my lord.
THERSITES:
Ha!
PATROCLUS:
What you say to't?
THERSITES:
God buy you, with all my heart.
PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.
THERSITES:
If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it
will go one way or other. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he
has me.
PATROCLUS:
Your answer, sir.
THERSITES:
Fare ye well, with all my heart.
ACHILLES:
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
THERSITES:
No, but he's out a tune thus. What music will be in him
when Hector has knock'd out his brains I know not; but, I am sure,
none; unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings
on.
ACHILLES:
Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
THERSITES:
Let me carry another to his horse; for that's the more
capable creature.
ACHILLES:
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
And I myself see not the bottom of it.
THERSITES:
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I
might water an ass at it. I had rather be a tick in a sheep than
such a valiant ignorance.
PARIS:
See, ho! Who is that there?
DEIPHOBUS:
It is the Lord Aeneas.
AENEAS:
Is the Prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
DIOMEDES:
That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.
PARIS:
A valiant Greek, Aeneas -take his hand:
Witness the process of your speech, wherein
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
Did haunt you in the field.
AENEAS:
Health to you, valiant sir,
During all question of the gentle truce;
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute.
DIOMEDES:
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health!
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit, and policy.
AENEAS:
And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
Welcome indeed! By Venus' hand I swear
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill, more excellently.
DIOMEDES:
We sympathise. Jove let Aeneas live,
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
But in mine emulous honour let him die
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
AENEAS:
We know each other well.
DIOMEDES:
We do; and long to know each other worse.
PARIS:
This is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
What business, lord, so early?
AENEAS:
I was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.
PARIS:
His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.
Let's have your company; or, if you please,
Haste there before us. I constantly believe-
Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge-
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night.
Rouse him and give him note of our approach,
With the whole quality wherefore; I fear
We shall be much unwelcome.
AENEAS:
That I assure you:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy.
PARIS:
There is no help;
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
AENEAS:
Good morrow, all.
PARIS:
And tell me, noble Diomed-faith, tell me true,
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship-
Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best,
Myself or Menelaus?
DIOMEDES:
Both alike:
He merits well to have her that doth seek her,
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
With such a hell of pain and world of charge;
And you as well to keep her that defend her,
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends.
He like a puling cuckold would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors.
Both merits pois'd, each weighs nor less nor more;
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
PARIS:
You are too bitter to your country-woman.
DIOMEDES:
She's bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death.
PARIS:
Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy;
But we in silence hold this virtue well:
We'll not commend what we intend to sell.
Here lies our way.
TROILUS:
Dear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.
CRESSIDA:
Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
He shall unbolt the gates.
TROILUS:
Trouble him not;
To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes,
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
As infants' empty of all thought!
CRESSIDA:
Good morrow, then.
TROILUS:
I prithee now, to bed.
CRESSIDA:
Are you aweary of me?
TROILUS:
O Cressida! but that the busy day,
Wak'd by the lark, hath rous'd the ribald crows,
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
I would not from thee.
CRESSIDA:
Night hath been too brief.
TROILUS:
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
You will catch cold, and curse me.
CRESSIDA:
Prithee tarry.
You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.
PANDARUS:
[Within] What's all the doors open here?
TROILUS:
It is your uncle.
CRESSIDA:
A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.
I shall have such a life!
PANDARUS:
How now, how now! How go maidenheads?
Here, you maid! Where's my cousin Cressid?
CRESSIDA:
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle.
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
PANDARUS:
To do what? to do what? Let her say what.
What have I brought you to do?
CRESSIDA:
Come, come, beshrew your heart! You'll ne'er be good,
Nor suffer others.
PANDARUS:
Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! a poor capocchia! hast not
slept to-night? Would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A
bugbear take him!
CRESSIDA:
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' th' head!
Who's that at door? Good uncle, go and see.
My lord, come you again into my chamber.
You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
TROILUS:
Ha! ha!
CRESSIDA:
Come, you are deceiv'd, I think of no such thing.
How earnestly they knock! Pray you come in:
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
PANDARUS:
Who's there? What's the matter? Will you beat down the
door? How now? What's the matter?
AENEAS:
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
PANDARUS:
Who's there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth,
I knew you not. What news with you so early?
AENEAS:
Is not Prince Troilus here?
PANDARUS:
Here! What should he do here?
AENEAS:
Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him.
It doth import him much to speak with me.
PANDARUS:
Is he here, say you? It's more than I know, I'll be
sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here?
AENEAS:
Who!-nay, then. Come, come, you'll do him wrong ere you are
ware; you'll be so true to him to be false to him. Do not you
know of him, but yet go fetch him hither; go.
TROILUS:
How now! What's the matter?
AENEAS:
My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
My matter is so rash. There is at hand
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
We must give up to Diomedes' hand
The Lady Cressida.
TROILUS:
Is it so concluded?
AENEAS:
By Priam, and the general state of Troy.
They are at hand and ready to effect it.
TROILUS:
How my achievements mock me!
I will go meet them; and, my lord Aeneas,
We met by chance; you did not find me here.
AENEAS:
Good, good, my lord, the secrets of neighbour Pandar
Have not more gift in taciturnity.
PANDARUS:
Is't possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take
Antenor! The young prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I
would they had broke's neck.
CRESSIDA:
How now! What's the matter? Who was here?
PANDARUS:
Ah, ah!
CRESSIDA:
Why sigh you so profoundly? Where's my lord? Gone? Tell
me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
CRESSIDA:
O the gods! What's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst ne'er been born!
I knew thou wouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague
upon Antenor!
CRESSIDA:
Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you,
what's the matter?
PANDARUS:
Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art
chang'd for Antenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from
Troilus. 'Twill be his death; 'twill be his bane; he cannot bear
it.
CRESSIDA:
O you immortal gods! I will not go.
PANDARUS:
Thou must.
CRESSIDA:
I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father;
I know no touch of consanguinity,
No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
Do to this body what extremes you can,
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth,
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep-
PANDARUS:
Do, do.
CRESSIDA:
Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks,
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart,
With sounding 'Troilus.' I will not go from Troy.
Exeunt
PARIS:
It is great morning; and the hour prefix'd
For her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
Tell you the lady what she is to do
And haste her to the purpose.
TROILUS:
Walk into her house.
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently;
And to his hand when I deliver her,
Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.
PARIS:
I know what 'tis to love,
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
Please you walk in, my lords.
PANDARUS:
Be moderate, be moderate.
CRESSIDA:
Why tell you me of moderation?
The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
And violenteth in a sense as strong
As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?
If I could temporize with my affections
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
The like allayment could I give my grief.
My love admits no qualifying dross;
No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
PANDARUS:
Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!
CRESSIDA:
O Troilus! Troilus!
PANDARUS:
What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. 'O
heart,' as the goodly saying is,
where he answers again
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we
may live to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How
now, lambs!
TROILUS:
Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
CRESSIDA:
Have the gods envy?
PANDARUS:
Ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
CRESSIDA:
And is it true that I must go from Troy?
TROILUS:
A hateful truth.
CRESSIDA:
What, and from Troilus too?
TROILUS:
From Troy and Troilus.
CRESSIDA:
Is't possible?
TROILUS:
And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath.
We two, that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how.
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
He fumbles up into a loose adieu,
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
AENEAS:
[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
TROILUS:
Hark! you are call'd. Some say the Genius so
Cries 'Come' to him that instantly must die.
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
PANDARUS:
Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart
will be blown up by th' root?
CRESSIDA:
I must then to the Grecians?
TROILUS:
No remedy.
CRESSIDA:
A woeful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?
TROILUS:
Hear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart-
CRESSIDA:
I true! how now! What wicked deem is this?
TROILUS:
Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
For it is parting from us.
I speak not 'Be thou true' as fearing thee,
For I will throw my glove to Death himself
That there's no maculation in thy heart;
But 'Be thou true' say I to fashion in
My sequent protestation: be thou true,
And I will see thee.
CRESSIDA:
O, you shall be expos'd, my lord, to dangers
As infinite as imminent! But I'll be true.
TROILUS:
And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
CRESSIDA:
And you this glove. When shall I see you?
TROILUS:
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
To give thee nightly visitation.
But yet be true.
CRESSIDA:
O heavens! 'Be true' again!
TROILUS:
Hear why I speak it, love.
The Grecian youths are full of quality;
They're loving, well compos'd with gifts of nature,
And flowing o'er with arts and exercise.
How novelties may move, and parts with person,
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy,
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin,
Makes me afeard.
CRESSIDA:
O heavens! you love me not.
TROILUS:
Die I a villain, then!
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
Nor play at subtle games-fair virtues all,
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant;
But I can tell that in each grace of these
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
That tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.
CRESSIDA:
Do you think I will?
TROILUS:
No.
But something may be done that we will not;
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
Presuming on their changeful potency.
AENEAS:
[Within] Nay, good my lord!
TROILUS:
Come, kiss; and let us part.
PARIS:
[Within] Brother Troilus!
TROILUS:
Good brother, come you hither;
And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.
CRESSIDA:
My lord, will you be true?
TROILUS:
Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault!
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
Is 'plain and true'; there's all the reach of it.
Welcome, Sir Diomed! Here is the lady
Which for Antenor we deliver you;
At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
And by the way possess thee what she is.
Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilion.
DIOMEDES:
Fair Lady Cressid,
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
TROILUS:
Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously
To shame the zeal of my petition to the
In praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
I'll cut thy throat.
DIOMEDES:
O, be not mov'd, Prince Troilus.
Let me be privileg'd by my place and message
To be a speaker free: when I am hence
I'll answer to my lust. And know you, lord,
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
She shall be priz'd. But that you say 'Be't so,'
I speak it in my spirit and honour, 'No.'
TROILUS:
Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
Lady, give me your hand; and, as we walk,
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
PARIS:
Hark! Hector's trumpet.
AENEAS:
How have we spent this morning!
The Prince must think me tardy and remiss,
That swore to ride before him to the field.
PARIS:
'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come to field with him.
DEIPHOBUS:
Let us make ready straight.
AENEAS:
Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels.
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry.
AGAMEMNON:
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant,
And hale him hither.
AJAX:
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe;
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
Out-swell the colic of puff Aquilon'd.
Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood:
Thou blowest for Hector.
ULYSSES:
No trumpet answers.
ACHILLES:
'Tis but early days.
AGAMEMNON:
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
ULYSSES:
'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait:
He rises on the toe. That spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
AGAMEMNON:
Is this the lady Cressid?
DIOMEDES:
Even she.
AGAMEMNON:
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
NESTOR:
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
ULYSSES:
Yet is the kindness but particular;
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
NESTOR:
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.
ACHILLES:
I'll take that winter from your lips, fair lady.
Achilles bids you welcome.
MENELAUS:
I had good argument for kissing once.
PATROCLUS:
But that's no argument for kissing now;
For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
And parted thus you and your argument.
ULYSSES:
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
PATROCLUS:
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine-
Patroclus kisses you.
MENELAUS:
O, this is trim!
PATROCLUS:
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
MENELAUS:
I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
CRESSIDA:
In kissing, do you render or receive?
PATROCLUS:
Both take and give.
CRESSIDA:
I'll make my match to live,
The kiss you take is better than you give;
Therefore no kiss.
MENELAUS:
I'll give you boot; I'll give you three for one.
CRESSIDA:
You are an odd man; give even or give none.
MENELAUS:
An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.
CRESSIDA:
No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true
That you are odd, and he is even with you.
MENELAUS:
You fillip me o' th' head.
CRESSIDA:
No, I'll be sworn.
ULYSSES:
It were no match, your nail against his horn.
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
CRESSIDA:
You may.
ULYSSES:
I do desire it.
CRESSIDA:
Why, beg then.
ULYSSES:
Why then, for Venus' sake give me a kiss
When Helen is a maid again, and his.
CRESSIDA:
I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.
ULYSSES:
Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
DIOMEDES:
Lady, a word. I'll bring you to your father.
NESTOR:
A woman of quick sense.
ULYSSES:
Fie, fie upon her!
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.
O these encounters so glib of tongue
That give a coasting welcome ere it comes,
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
To every ticklish reader! Set them down
For sluttish spoils of opportunity,
And daughters of the game.
ALL:
The Troyans' trumpet.
AGAMEMNON:
Yonder comes the troop.
AENEAS:
Hail, all the state of Greece! What shall be done
To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other, or shall they be divided
By any voice or order of the field?
Hector bade ask.
AGAMEMNON:
Which way would Hector have it?
AENEAS:
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
ACHILLES:
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
The knight oppos'd.
AENEAS:
If not Achilles, sir,
What is your name?
ACHILLES:
If not Achilles, nothing.
AENEAS:
Therefore Achilles. But whate'er, know this:
In the extremity of great and little
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
The one almost as infinite as all,
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood;
In love whereof half Hector stays at home;
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight, half Troyan and half Greek.
ACHILLES:
A maiden battle then? O, I perceive you!
AGAMEMNON:
Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord ]Eneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,
So be it; either to the uttermost,
Or else a breath. The combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
ULYSSES:
They are oppos'd already.
AGAMEMNON:
What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?
ULYSSES:
The youngest son of Priam, a true knight;
Not yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word;
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
Not soon provok'd, nor being provok'd soon calm'd;
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love.
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth
Even to his inches, and, with private soul,
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
AGAMEMNON:
They are in action.
NESTOR:
Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
TROILUS:
Hector, thou sleep'st;
Awake thee.
AGAMEMNON:
His blows are well dispos'd. There, Ajax!
DIOMEDES:
You must no more.
AENEAS:
Princes, enough, so please you.
AJAX:
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
DIOMEDES:
As Hector pleases.
HECTOR:
Why, then will I no more.
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so
That thou could'st say 'This hand is Grecian all,
And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
Bounds in my father's'; by Jove multipotent,
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
Hector would have them fall upon him thus.
Cousin, all honour to thee!
AJAX:
I thank thee, Hector.
Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death.
HECTOR:
Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Cries 'This is he' could promise to himself
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
AENEAS:
There is expectance here from both the sides
What further you will do.
HECTOR:
We'll answer it:
The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.
AJAX:
If I might in entreaties find success,
As seld I have the chance, I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
DIOMEDES:
'Tis Agamemnon's wish; and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
HECTOR:
Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Troyan part;
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
I will go eat with thee, and see your knights.
AJAX:
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
HECTOR:
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
But for Achilles, my own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size.
AGAMEMNON:
Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy.
But that's no welcome. Understand more clear,
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee with most divine integrity,
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
HECTOR:
I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
AGAMEMNON:
[To Troilus] My well-fam'd lord of Troy, no less to you.
MENELAUS:
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting.
You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
HECTOR:
Who must we answer?
AENEAS:
The noble Menelaus.
HECTOR:
O you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not that I affect the untraded oath;
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove.
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
MENELAUS:
Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
HECTOR:
O, pardon; I offend.
NESTOR:
I have, thou gallant Troyan, seen thee oft,
Labouring for destiny, make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
Despising many forfeits and subduements,
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' th' air,
Not letting it decline on the declined;
That I have said to some my standers-by
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
Like an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen;
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
And once fought with him. He was a soldier good,
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
Never like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee;
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
AENEAS:
'Tis the old Nestor.
HECTOR:
Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time.
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
NESTOR:
I would my arms could match thee in contention
As they contend with thee in courtesy.
HECTOR:
I would they could.
NESTOR:
Ha!
By this white beard, I'd fight with thee to-morrow.
Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
ULYSSES:
I wonder now how yonder city stands,
When we have here her base and pillar by us.
HECTOR:
I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Troyan dead,
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion on your Greekish embassy.
ULYSSES:
Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
Must kiss their own feet.
HECTOR:
I must not believe you.
There they stand yet; and modestly I think
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood. The end
DUKE:
If music be the food of love, play on,
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken and so die.
That strain again! It had a dying fall;
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more;
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy,
That it alone is high fantastical.
CURIO:
Will you go hunt, my lord?
DUKE:
What, Curio?
CURIO:
The hart.
DUKE:
Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence!
That instant was I turn'd into a hart,
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
E'er since pursue me.
How now! what news from her?
VALENTINE:
So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
But from her handmaid do return this answer:
The element itself, till seven years' heat,
Shall not behold her face at ample view;
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,
And water once a day her chamber round
With eye-offending brine; all this to season
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
DUKE:
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
How will she love when the rich golden shaft
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill'd,
Her sweet perfections, with one self king!
Away before me to sweet beds of flow'rs:
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs.
VIOLA:
What country, friends, is this?
CAPTAIN:
This is Illyria, lady.
VIOLA:
And what should I do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.
Perchance he is not drown'd- what think you, sailors?
CAPTAIN:
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
VIOLA:
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
CAPTAIN:
True, madam, and, to comfort you with chance,
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
When you, and those poor number saved with you,
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Most provident in peril, bind himself-
Courage and hope both teaching him the practice-
To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see.
VIOLA:
For saying so, there's gold.
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
CAPTAIN:
Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
Not three hours' travel from this very place.
VIOLA:
Who governs here?
CAPTAIN:
A noble duke, in nature as in name.
VIOLA:
What is his name?
CAPTAIN:
Orsino.
VIOLA:
Orsino! I have heard my father name him.
He was a bachelor then.
CAPTAIN:
And so is now, or was so very late;
For but a month ago I went from hence,
And then 'twas fresh in murmur- as, you know,
What great ones do the less will prattle of-
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
VIOLA:
What's she?
CAPTAIN:
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
In the protection of his son, her brother,
Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
They say, she hath abjur'd the company
And sight of men.
VIOLA:
O that I serv'd that lady,
And might not be delivered to the world,
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
What my estate is!
CAPTAIN:
That were hard to compass,
Because she will admit no kind of suit-
No, not the Duke's.
VIOLA:
There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall become
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music,
That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap to time I will commit;
Only shape thou silence to my wit.
CAPTAIN:
Be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be;
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
VIOLA:
I thank thee. Lead me on.
SIR TOBY:
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her
brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
MARIA:
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights;
your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
SIR TOBY:
Why, let her except before excepted.
MARIA:
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits
of order.
SIR TOBY:
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These
clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too;
an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
MARIA:
That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady
talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in
one night here to be her wooer.
SIR TOBY:
Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
MARIA:
Ay, he.
SIR TOBY:
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
MARIA:
What's that to th' purpose?
SIR TOBY:
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
MARIA:
Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a
very fool and a prodigal.
SIR TOBY:
Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys,
and speaks three or four languages word for word without book,
and hath all the good gifts of nature.
MARIA:
He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a
fool, he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a
coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought
among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
SIR TOBY:
By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that
say so of him. Who are they?
MARIA:
They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
SIR TOBY:
With drinking healths to my niece; I'll drink to her as
long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.
He's a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece
till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
AGUECHEEK:
Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
SIR TOBY:
Sweet Sir Andrew!
AGUECHEEK:
Bless you, fair shrew.
MARIA:
And you too, sir.
SIR TOBY:
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
AGUECHEEK:
What's that?
SIR TOBY:
My niece's chambermaid.
AGUECHEEK:
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
MARIA:
My name is Mary, sir.
AGUECHEEK:
Good Mistress Mary Accost-
SIR TOBY:
You mistake, knight. 'Accost' is front her, board her,
woo her, assail her.
AGUECHEEK:
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
MARIA:
Fare you well, gentlemen.
SIR TOBY:
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never
draw sword again!
AGUECHEEK:
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw
sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
MARIA:
Sir, I have not you by th' hand.
AGUECHEEK:
Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
MARIA:
Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to
th' buttry-bar and let it drink.
AGUECHEEK:
Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?
MARIA:
It's dry, sir.
AGUECHEEK:
Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my
hand dry. But what's your jest?
MARIA:
A dry jest, sir.
AGUECHEEK:
Are you full of them?
MARIA:
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends; marry, now I let
go your hand, I am barren.
SIR TOBY:
O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary! When did I see
thee so put down?
AGUECHEEK:
Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian
or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and I
believe that does harm to my wit.
SIR TOBY:
No question.
AGUECHEEK:
An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home
to-morrow, Sir Toby.
SIR TOBY:
Pourquoi, my dear knight?
AGUECHEEK:
What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed
that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and
bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts!
SIR TOBY:
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
AGUECHEEK:
Why, would that have mended my hair?
SIR TOBY:
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
AGUECHEEK:
But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
SIR TOBY:
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to
see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
AGUECHEEK:
Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will
not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me;
the Count himself here hard by woos her.
SIR TOBY:
She'll none o' th' Count; she'll not match above her
degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her
swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.
AGUECHEEK:
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest
mind i' th' world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes
altogether.
SIR TOBY:
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
AGUECHEEK:
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.
SIR TOBY:
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
AGUECHEEK:
Faith, I can cut a caper.
SIR TOBY:
And I can cut the mutton to't.
AGUECHEEK:
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as
any man in Illyria.
SIR TOBY:
Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these
gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like
Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a
galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a
jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by
the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form'd under the
star of a galliard.
AGUECHEEK:
Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in
flame-colour'd stock. Shall we set about some revels?
SIR TOBY:
What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?
AGUECHEEK:
Taurus? That's sides and heart.
SIR TOBY:
No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. Ha,
higher! Ha, ha, excellent!
VALENTINE:
If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario,
you are like to be much advanc'd; he hath known you but three
days, and already you are no stranger.
VIOLA:
You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call
in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir,
in his favours?
VALENTINE:
No, believe me.
VIOLA:
I thank you. Here comes the Count.
DUKE:
Who saw Cesario, ho?
VIOLA:
On your attendance, my lord, here.
DUKE:
Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,
Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
To thee the book even of my secret soul.
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
Till thou have audience.
VIOLA:
Sure, my noble lord,
If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
DUKE:
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,
Rather than make unprofited return.
VIOLA:
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
DUKE:
O, then unfold the passion of my love,
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith!
It shall become thee well to act my woes:
She will attend it better in thy youth
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
VIOLA:
I think not so, my lord.
DUKE:
Dear lad, believe it,
For they shall yet belie thy happy years
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
And all is semblative a woman's part.
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. Some four or five attend him-
All, if you will, for I myself am best
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA:
I'll do my best
To woo your lady. Yet, a barful strife!
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
MARIA:
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open
my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse; my
lady will hang thee for thy absence.
CLOWN:
Let her hang me. He that is well hang'd in this world needs
to fear no colours.
MARIA:
Make that good.
CLOWN:
He shall see none to fear.
MARIA:
A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was
born, of 'I fear no colours.'
CLOWN:
Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA:
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your
foolery.
CLOWN:
Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are
fools, let them use their talents.
MARIA:
Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent; or to be
turn'd away- is not that as good as a hanging to you?
CLOWN:
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning
away, let summer bear it out.
MARIA:
You are resolute, then?
CLOWN:
Not so, neither; but I am resolv'd on two points.
MARIA:
That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break,
your gaskins fall.
CLOWN:
Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby
would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh
as any in Illyria.
MARIA:
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady. Make
your excuse wisely, you were best.
CLOWN:
Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits
that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am
sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says
Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.' God bless
thee, lady!
OLIVIA:
Take the fool away.
CLOWN:
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
OLIVIA:
Go to, y'are a dry fool; I'll no more of you. Besides, you
grow dishonest.
CLOWN:
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend;
for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the
dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer
dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything
that's mended is but patch'd; virtue that transgresses is but
patch'd with sin, and sin that amends is but patch'd with virtue.
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so
beauty's a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I
say again, take her away.
OLIVIA:
Sir, I bade them take away you.
CLOWN:
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, 'Cucullus non facit
monachum'; that's as much to say as I wear not motley in my
brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.
OLIVIA:
Can you do it?
CLOWN:
Dexteriously, good madonna.
OLIVIA:
Make your proof.
CLOWN:
I must catechize you for it, madonna.
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
OLIVIA:
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your
proof.
CLOWN:
Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?
OLIVIA:
Good fool, for my brother's death.
CLOWN:
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
OLIVIA:
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
CLOWN:
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul
being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
OLIVIA:
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?
MALVOLIO:
Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him.
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
CLOWN:
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better
increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox;
but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.
OLIVIA:
How say you to that, Malvolio?
MALVOLIO:
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren
rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool
that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of
his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,
he is gagg'd. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at
these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.
OLIVIA:
O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a
distemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free
disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he
do nothing but rail; nor no railing in known discreet man, though
he do nothing but reprove.
CLOWN:
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well
of fools!
MARIA:
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires
to speak with you.
OLIVIA:
From the Count Orsino, is it?
MARIA:
I know not, madam; 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
OLIVIA:
Who of my people hold him in delay?
MARIA:
Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
OLIVIA:
Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman.
Fie on him! Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from
the Count, I am sick, or not at home- what you will to dismiss
it. Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
and people dislike it.
CLOWN:
Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should
be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! For- here he comes-
one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.
OLIVIA:
By mine honour, half drunk! What is he at the gate, cousin?
SIR TOBY:
A gentleman.
OLIVIA:
A gentleman! What gentleman?
SIR TOBY:
'Tis a gentleman here. A plague o' these
pickle-herring! How now, sot!
CLOWN:
Good Sir Toby!
OLIVIA:
Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this
lethargy?
SIR TOBY:
Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
OLIVIA:
Ay, marry; what is he?
SIR TOBY:
Let him be the devil an he will, I care not; give me
faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
OLIVIA:
What's a drunken man like, fool?
CLOWN:
Like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above
heat makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns
him.
OLIVIA:
Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz;
for he's in the third degree of drink, he's drown'd; go look
after him.
CLOWN:
He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the
madman.
MALVOLIO:
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I
told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much,
asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and
therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
lady? He's fortified against any denial.
OLIVIA:
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
MALVOLIO:
Has been told so; and he says he'll stand at your door
like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll
speak with you.
OLIVIA:
What kind o' man is he?
MALVOLIO:
Why, of mankind.
OLIVIA:
What manner of man?
MALVOLIO:
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
OLIVIA:
Of what personage and years is he?
MALVOLIO:
Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy;
as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a codling when 'tis
almost an apple; 'tis with him in standing water, between boy and
man. He is very well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
OLIVIA:
Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
MALVOLIO:
Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
OLIVIA:
Give me my veil; come, throw it o'er my face;
We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
VIOLA:
The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
OLIVIA:
Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?
VIOLA:
Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty- I pray you
tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I
would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is
excellently well penn'd, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to
the least sinister usage.
OLIVIA:
Whence came you, sir?
VIOLA:
I can say little more than I have studied, and that
question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest
assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in
my speech.
OLIVIA:
Are you a comedian?
VIOLA:
No, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice
I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?
OLIVIA:
If I do not usurp myself, I am.
VIOLA:
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for
what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from
my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then
show you the heart of my message.
OLIVIA:
Come to what is important in't. I forgive you the praise.
VIOLA:
Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
OLIVIA:
It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I
heard you were saucy at my gates, and allow'd your approach
rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be
gone; if you have reason, be brief; 'tis not that time of moon
with me to make one in so skipping dialogue.
MARIA:
Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
VIOLA:
No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer.
Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
OLIVIA:
Tell me your mind.
VIOLA:
I am a messenger.
OLIVIA:
Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the
courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
VIOLA:
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no
taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as
full of peace as matter.
OLIVIA:
Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?
VIOLA:
The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my
entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as
maidenhead- to your cars, divinity; to any other's, profanation.
OLIVIA:
Give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.
VIOLA:
Most sweet lady-
OLIVIA:
A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
Where lies your text?
VIOLA:
In Orsino's bosom.
OLIVIA:
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
VIOLA:
To answer by the method: in the first of his heart.
OLIVIA:
O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
VIOLA:
Good madam, let me see your face.
OLIVIA:
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
face? You are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain
and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I
was this present. Is't not well done?
VIOLA:
Excellently done, if God did all.
OLIVIA:
'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
VIOLA:
'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on.
Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
If you will lead these graces to the grave,
And leave the world no copy.
OLIVIA:
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out
divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every
particle and utensil labell'd to my will: as- item, two lips
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one
neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
VIOLA:
I see you what you are: you are too proud;
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
My lord and master loves you- O, such love
Could be but recompens'd though you were crown'd
The nonpareil of beauty!
OLIVIA:
How does he love me?
VIOLA:
With adorations, fertile tears,
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
OLIVIA:
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him.
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
In voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant,
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
He might have took his answer long ago.
VIOLA:
If I did love you in my master's flame,
With such a suff'ring, such a deadly life,
In your denial I would find no sense;
I would not understand it.
OLIVIA:
Why, what would you?
VIOLA:
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
And call upon my soul within the house;
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
Halloo your name to the reverberate hals,
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Cry out 'Olivia!' O, you should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth
But you should pity me!
OLIVIA:
You might do much.
What is your parentage?
VIOLA:
Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
I am a gentleman.
OLIVIA:
Get you to your lord.
I cannot love him; let him send no more-
Unless perchance you come to me again
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well.
I thank you for your pains; spend this for me.
VIOLA:
I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse;
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
And let your fervour, like my master's, be
Plac'd in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
OLIVIA:
'What is your parentage?'
'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit,
Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast! Soft, soft!
Unless the master were the man. How now!
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
With an invisible and subtle stealth
To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
What ho, Malvolio!
MALVOLIO:
Here, madam, at your service.
OLIVIA:
Run after that same peevish messenger,
The County's man. He left this ring behind him,
Would I or not. Tell him I'll none of it.
Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him.
If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
I'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio.
MALVOLIO:
Madam, I will.
OLIVIA:
I do I know not what, and fear to find
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
What is decreed must be; and be this so!
ANTONIO:
Will you stay no longer; nor will you not that I go with
you?
SEBASTIAN:
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the
malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I
shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It
were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
ANTONIO:
Let me know of you whither you are bound.
SEBASTIAN:
No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of
modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to
keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
which I call'd Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of
Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him
myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had
been pleas'd, would we had so ended! But you, sir, alter'd that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was
my sister drown'd.
ANTONIO:
Alas the day!
SEBASTIAN:
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,
was yet of many accounted beautiful; but though I could not with
such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will
boldly publish her: she bore mind that envy could not but call
fair. She is drown'd already, sir, with salt water, though I seem
to drown her remembrance again with more.
ANTONIO:
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
SEBASTIAN:
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
ANTONIO:
If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your
servant.
SEBASTIAN:
If you will not undo what you have done- that is, kill
him whom you have recover'd-desire it not. Fare ye well at once;
my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of
my mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court. Farewell.
ANTONIO:
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
I have many cnemies in Orsino's court,
Else would I very shortly see thee there.
But come what may, I do adore thee so
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
MALVOLIO:
Were you not ev'n now with the Countess Olivia?
VIOLA:
Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arriv'd but
hither.
MALVOLIO:
She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved
me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover,
that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will
none of him. And one thing more: that you be never so hardy to
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's
taking of this. Receive it so.
VIOLA:
She took the ring of me; I'll none of it.
MALVOLIO:
Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is
it should be so return'd. If it be worth stooping for, there it
lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.
VIOLA:
I left no ring with her; what means this lady?
Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
She made good view of me; indeed, so much
That methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
For she did speak in starts distractedly.
She loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion
Invites me in this churlish messenger.
None of my lord's ring! Why, he sent her none.
I am the man. If it be so- as 'tis-
Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
How easy is it for the proper-false
In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
For such as we are made of, such we be.
How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
What will become of this? As I am man,
My state is desperate for my master's love;
As I am woman- now alas the day!-
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
O Time, thou must untangle this, not I;
It is too hard a knot for me t' untie!
SIR TOBY:
Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to
be up betimes; and 'diluculo surgere' thou know'st-
AGUECHEEK:
Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
is to be up late.
SIR TOBY:
A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be
up after midnight and to go to bed then is early; so that to go
to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives
consist of the four elements?
AGUECHEEK:
Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
eating and drinking.
SIR TOBY:
Th'art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
Marian, I say! a stoup of wine.
AGUECHEEK:
Here comes the fool, i' faith.
CLOWN:
How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of 'we
three'?
SIR TOBY:
Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
AGUECHEEK:
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had
rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a
breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very
gracious fooling last night, when thou spok'st of Pigrogromitus,
of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; 'twas very
good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?
CLOWN:
I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no
whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no
bottle-ale houses.
AGUECHEEK:
Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
done. Now, a song.
SIR TOBY:
Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let's have a song.
AGUECHEEK:
There's a testril of me too; if one knight give a-
SIR TOBY:
A love-song, a love-song.
AGUECHEEK:
Ay, ay; I care not for good life.
AGUECHEEK:
Excellent good, i' faith!
SIR TOBY:
Good, good!
AGUECHEEK:
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
SIR TOBY:
A contagious breath.
AGUECHEEK:
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
SIR TOBY:
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall
we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in
a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do
that?
AGUECHEEK:
An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.
CLOWN:
By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
AGUECHEEK:
Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.'
CLOWN:
'Hold thy peace, thou knave' knight? I shall be constrain'd
in't to call thee knave, knight.
AGUECHEEK:
'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call
me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
CLOWN:
I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
AGUECHEEK:
Good, i' faith! Come, begin.
MARIA:
What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not
call'd up her steward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of
doors, never trust me.
SIR TOBY:
My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a
Peg-a-Ramsey, and
Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tilly-vally,
lady.
CLOWN:
Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
AGUECHEEK:
Ay, he does well enough if he be dispos'd, and so do I
too; he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.
SIR TOBY:
[Sings] O' the twelfth day of December-
MARIA:
For the love o' God, peace!
MALVOLIO:
My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no
wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this
time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady's house, that
ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or
remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
time, in you?
SIR TOBY:
We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
MALVOLIO:
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell
you that, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she's nothing
allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your
misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, and it would
please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you
farewell.
SIR TOBY:
[Sings] Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.
MARIA:
Nay, good Sir Toby.
CLOWN:
[Sings] His eyes do show his days are almost done.
MALVOLIO:
Is't even so?
SIR TOBY:
[Sings] But I will never die.
CLOWN:
[Sings] Sir Toby, there you lie.
MALVOLIO:
This is much credit to you.
SIR TOBY:
[Sings] Shall I bid him go?
CLOWN:
[Sings] What an if you do?
SIR TOBY:
[Sings] Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
CLOWN:
[Sings] O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.
SIR TOBY:
[Rising] Out o' tune, sir! Ye lie. Art any more than a
steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall
be no more cakes and ale?
CLOWN:
Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' th' mouth
too.
SIR TOBY:
Th' art i' th' right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs.
A stoup of wine, Maria!
MALVOLIO:
Mistress Mary, if you priz'd my lady's favour at anything
more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil
rule; she shall know of it, by this hand.
MARIA:
Go shake your ears.
AGUECHEEK:
'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's ahungry,
to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him
and make a fool of him.
SIR TOBY:
Do't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
MARIA:
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of
the Count's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet.
For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him; if I do not gull
him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can
do it.
SIR TOBY:
Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
MARIA:
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.
AGUECHEEK:
O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog.
SIR TOBY:
What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear
knight?
AGUECHEEK:
I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good
enough.
MARIA:
The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a
time-pleaser; an affection'd ass that cons state without book and
cramm'd, as he thinks, with excellencies that it is his grounds
of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in
him will my revenge find notable cause to work.
SIR TOBY:
What wilt thou do?
MARIA:
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;
wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the
manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and
complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I
can write very like my lady, your niece; on forgotten matter we
can hardly make distinction of our hands.
SIR TOBY:
Excellent! I smell a device.
AGUECHEEK:
I have't in my nose too.
SIR TOBY:
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that
they come from my niece, and that she's in love with him.
MARIA:
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
AGUECHEEK:
And your horse now would make him an ass.
MARIA:
Ass, I doubt not.
AGUECHEEK:
O, 'twill be admirable!
MARIA:
Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with
him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where
he shall find the letter; observe his construction of it. For
this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
SIR TOBY:
Good night, Penthesilea.
AGUECHEEK:
Before me, she's a good wench.
SIR TOBY:
She's a beagle true-bred, and one that adores me.
What o' that?
AGUECHEEK:
I was ador'd once too.
SIR TOBY:
Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more
money.
AGUECHEEK:
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
SIR TOBY:
Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i' th' end,
call me Cut.
AGUECHEEK:
If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.
SIR TOBY:
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late to go
to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight.
DUKE:
Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
That old and antique song we heard last night;
Methought it did relieve my passion much,
More than light airs and recollected terms
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.
Come, but one verse.
CURIO:
He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing
it.
DUKE:
Who was it?
CURIO:
Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the Lady Olivia's
father took much delight in. He is about the house.
DUKE:
Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
For such as I am all true lovers are,
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
Save in the constant image of the creature
That is belov'd. How dost thou like this tune?
VIOLA:
It gives a very echo to the seat
Where Love is thron'd.
DUKE:
Thou dost speak masterly.
My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves;
Hath it not, boy?
VIOLA:
A little, by your favour.
DUKE:
What kind of woman is't?
VIOLA:
Of your complexion.
DUKE:
She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
VIOLA:
About your years, my lord.
DUKE:
Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take
An elder than herself; so wears she to him,
So sways she level in her husband's heart.
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won,
Than women's are.
VIOLA:
I think it well, my lord.
DUKE:
Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
For women are as roses, whose fair flow'r
Being once display'd doth fall that very hour.
VIOLA:
And so they are; alas, that they are so!
To die, even when they to perfection grow!
DUKE:
O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain;
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,
Do use to chant it; it is silly sooth,
And dallies with the innocence of love,
Like the old age.
CLOWN:
Are you ready, sir?
DUKE:
Ay; prithee, sing.
DUKE:
There's for thy pains.
CLOWN:
No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir.
DUKE:
I'll pay thy pleasure, then.
CLOWN:
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another.
DUKE:
Give me now leave to leave thee.
CLOWN:
Now the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy
doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I
would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business
might be everything, and their intent everywhere: for that's it
that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
DUKE:
Let all the rest give place.
Once more, Cesario,
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world,
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune;
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
VIOLA:
But if she cannot love you, sir?
DUKE:
I cannot be so answer'd.
VIOLA:
Sooth, but you must.
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;
You tell her so. Must she not then be answer'd?
DUKE:
There is no woman's sides
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
So big to hold so much; they lack retention.
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-
No motion of the liver, but the palate-
That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
And can digest as much. Make no compare
Between that love a woman can bear me
And that I owe Olivia.
VIOLA:
Ay, but I know-
DUKE:
What dost thou know?
VIOLA:
Too well what love women to men may owe.
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
My father had a daughter lov'd a man,
As it might be perhaps, were I a woman,
I should your lordship.
DUKE:
And what's her history?
VIOLA:
A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,
Feed on her damask cheek. She pin'd in thought;
And with a green and yellow melancholy
She sat like Patience on a monument,
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
We men may say more, swear more, but indeed
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
Much in our vows, but little in our love.
DUKE:
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
VIOLA:
I am all the daughters of my father's house,
And all the brothers too- and yet I know not.
Sir, shall I to this lady?
DUKE:
Ay, that's the theme.
To her in haste. Give her this jewel; say
My love can give no place, bide no denay.
SIR TOBY:
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
FABIAN:
Nay, I'll come; if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be
boil'd to death with melancholy.
SIR TOBY:
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally
sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
FABIAN:
I would exult, man; you know he brought me out o' favour
with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
SIR TOBY:
To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will fool
him black and blue- shall we not, Sir Andrew?
AGUECHEEK:
And we do not, it is pity of our lives.
SIR TOBY:
Here comes the little villain.
How now, my metal of India!
MARIA:
Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio's coming down
this walk. He has been yonder i' the sun practising behaviour to
his own shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love of
mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot
of him. Close, in the name of jesting! [As the men hide she drops
a letter] Lie thou there; for here comes the trout that must be
caught with tickling.
MALVOLIO:
'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told me she
did affect me; and I have heard herself come thus near, that,
should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she
uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that
follows her. What should I think on't?
SIR TOBY:
Here's an overweening rogue!
FABIAN:
O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him;
how he jets under his advanc'd plumes!
AGUECHEEK:
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue-
SIR TOBY:
Peace, I say.
MALVOLIO:
To be Count Malvolio!
SIR TOBY:
Ah, rogue!
AGUECHEEK:
Pistol him, pistol him.
SIR TOBY:
Peace, peace!
MALVOLIO:
There is example for't: the Lady of the Strachy married
the yeoman of the wardrobe.
AGUECHEEK:
Fie on him, Jezebel!
FABIAN:
O, peace! Now he's deeply in; look how imagination blows
him.
MALVOLIO:
Having been three months married to her, sitting in my
state-
SIR TOBY:
O, for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye!
MALVOLIO:
Calling my officers about me, in my branch'd velvet gown,
having come from a day-bed- where I have left Olivia sleeping-
SIR TOBY:
Fire and brimstone!
FABIAN:
O, peace, peace!
MALVOLIO:
And then to have the humour of state; and after a demure
travel of regard, telling them I know my place as I would they
should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby-
SIR TOBY:
Bolts and shackles!
FABIAN:
O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
MALVOLIO:
Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for
him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play
with my- some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me-
SIR TOBY:
Shall this fellow live?
FABIAN:
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
MALVOLIO:
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile
SIR TOBY:
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
MALVOLIO:
Saying 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your
niece give me this prerogative of speech'-
SIR TOBY:
What, what?
MALVOLIO:
'You must amend your drunkenness'-
SIR TOBY:
Out, scab!
FABIAN:
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
MALVOLIO:
'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a
foolish knight'-
AGUECHEEK:
That's me, I warrant you.
MALVOLIO:
'One Sir Andrew.'
AGUECHEEK:
I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
MALVOLIO:
What employment have we here?
FABIAN:
Now is the woodcock near the gin.
SIR TOBY:
O, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading
aloud to him!
MALVOLIO:
By my life, this is my lady's hand: these be her very
C's, her U's, and her T's; and thus makes she her great P's. It
is, in contempt of question, her hand.
AGUECHEEK:
Her C's, her U's, and her T's. Why that?
MALVOLIO:
[Reads] 'To the unknown belov'd, this, and my good
wishes.' Her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! And the
impressure her Lucrece with which she uses to seal; 'tis my lady.
To whom should this be?
FABIAN:
This wins him, liver and all.
MALVOLIO:
[Reads]
'No man must know.' What follows? The numbers alter'd!
'No man must know.' If this should be thee, Malvolio?
SIR TOBY:
Marry, hang thee, brock!
MALVOLIO:
[Reads]
FABIAN:
A fustian riddle!
SIR TOBY:
Excellent wench, say I.
MALVOLIO:
'M. O. A. I. doth sway my life.'
Nay, but first let me see, let me see, let me see.
FABIAN:
What dish o' poison has she dress'd him!
SIR TOBY:
And with what wing the staniel checks at it!
MALVOLIO:
'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me: I
serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal
capacity; there is no obstruction in this. And the end
VALENTINE:
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,
Even as I would, when I to love begin.
PROTEUS:
Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy headsman, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
And on a love-book pray for my success?
PROTEUS:
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
VALENTINE:
That's on some shallow story of deep love:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
PROTEUS:
That's a deep story of a deeper love;
For he was more than over shoes in love.
VALENTINE:
'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
PROTEUS:
Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.
VALENTINE:
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
PROTEUS:
What?
VALENTINE:
To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
PROTEUS:
So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
VALENTINE:
So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
PROTEUS:
'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.
VALENTINE:
Love is your master, for he masters you;
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
PROTEUS:
Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
VALENTINE:
And writers say, as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure even in the prime,
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel the
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu. My father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
PROTEUS:
And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
PROTEUS:
All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
VALENTINE:
As much to you at home; and so farewell!
PROTEUS:
He after honour hunts, I after love;
He leaves his friends to dignify them more:
I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
SPEED:
Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
PROTEUS:
But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.
SPEED:
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
PROTEUS:
Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
An if the shepherd be awhile away.
SPEED:
You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and
I a sheep?
PROTEUS:
I do.
SPEED:
Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
PROTEUS:
A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.
SPEED:
This proves me still a sheep.
PROTEUS:
True; and thy master a shepherd.
SPEED:
Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
PROTEUS:
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
SPEED:
The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me;
therefore, I am no sheep.
PROTEUS:
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for
food follows not the sheep: thou for wages followest thy master;
thy master for wages follows not thee. Therefore, thou art a
sheep.
SPEED:
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
PROTEUS:
But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?
SPEED:
Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd
mutton; and she, a lac'd mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing
for my labour.
PROTEUS:
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
SPEED:
If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.
PROTEUS:
Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.
SPEED:
Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
letter.
PROTEUS:
You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.
SPEED:
From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
PROTEUS:
But what said she?
SPEED:
[Nodding]
PROTEUS:
Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'
SPEED:
You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she
did nod; and I say 'Ay.'
PROTEUS:
And that set together is 'noddy.'
SPEED:
Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for
your pains.
PROTEUS:
No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
SPEED:
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
PROTEUS:
Why, sir, how do you bear with me?
SPEED:
Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the
word 'noddy' for my pains.
PROTEUS:
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
SPEED:
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
PROTEUS:
Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?
SPEED:
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both
at once delivered.
PROTEUS:
Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
SPEED:
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
PROTEUS:
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
SPEED:
Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so
much as a ducat for delivering your letter; and being so hard to
me that brought your mind, I fear she'll prove as hard to you in
telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as
hard as steel.
PROTEUS:
What said she? Nothing?
SPEED:
No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify
your bounty, I thank you, you have testern'd me; in requital
whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself; and so, sir,
I'll commend you to my master.
PROTEUS:
Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
Which cannot perish, having thee aboard,
Being destin'd to a drier death on shore.
I must go send some better messenger.
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Receiving them from such a worthless post.
JULIA:
But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
LUCETTA:
Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.
JULIA:
Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me,
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
LUCETTA:
Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
LUCETTA:
As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
But, were I you, he never should be mine.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
LUCETTA:
Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
JULIA:
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
LUCETTA:
Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
JULIA:
How now! what means this passion at his name?
LUCETTA:
Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame
That I, unworthy body as I am,
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
JULIA:
Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
LUCETTA:
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
JULIA:
Your reason?
LUCETTA:
I have no other but a woman's reason:
I think him so, because I think him so.
JULIA:
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
LUCETTA:
Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
JULIA:
Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.
LUCETTA:
Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
JULIA:
His little speaking shows his love but small.
LUCETTA:
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
JULIA:
They do not love that do not show their love.
LUCETTA:
O, they love least that let men know their love.
JULIA:
I would I knew his mind.
LUCETTA:
Peruse this paper, madam.
JULIA:
'To Julia'- Say, from whom?
LUCETTA:
That the contents will show.
JULIA:
Say, say, who gave it thee?
LUCETTA:
Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.
JULIA:
Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,
And you an officer fit for the place.
There, take the paper; see it be return'd;
Or else return no more into my sight.
LUCETTA:
To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
JULIA:
Will ye be gone?
LUCETTA:
That you may ruminate.
JULIA:
And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.
It were a shame to call her back again,
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
What fool is she, that knows I am a maid
And would not force the letter to my view!
Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that
Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,
And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
When willingly I would have had her here!
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!
LUCETTA:
What would your ladyship?
JULIA:
Is't near dinner time?
LUCETTA:
I would it were,
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
And not upon your maid.
JULIA:
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
LUCETTA:
Nothing.
JULIA:
Why didst thou stoop then?
LUCETTA:
To take a paper up that I let fall.
JULIA:
And is that paper nothing?
LUCETTA:
Nothing concerning me.
JULIA:
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
LUCETTA:
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
Unless it have a false interpreter.
JULIA:
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
LUCETTA:
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
Give me a note; your ladyship can set.
JULIA:
As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love.'
LUCETTA:
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
JULIA:
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.
LUCETTA:
Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.
JULIA:
And why not you?
LUCETTA:
I cannot reach so high.
JULIA:
Let's see your song.
How now, minion!
LUCETTA:
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
JULIA:
You do not!
LUCETTA:
No, madam; 'tis too sharp.
JULIA:
You, minion, are too saucy.
LUCETTA:
Nay, now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant;
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
JULIA:
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
LUCETTA:
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
JULIA:
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie.
You would be fing'ring them, to anger me.
LUCETTA:
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd
To be so ang'red with another letter.
JULIA:
Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia,
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom,,as a bed,
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter-
Except mine own name; that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
And throw it thence into the raging sea.
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ:
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia.' That I'll tear away;
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one upon another;
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
LUCETTA:
Madam,
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
JULIA:
Well, let us go.
LUCETTA:
What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
JULIA:
If you respect them, best to take them up.
LUCETTA:
Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold.
JULIA:
I see you have a month's mind to them.
LUCETTA:
Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
I see things too, although you judge I wink.
JULIA:
Come, come; will't please you go?
ANTONIO:
Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
PANTHINO:
'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
ANTONIO:
Why, what of him?
PANTHINO:
He wond'red that your lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
While other men, of slender reputation,
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.
For any, or for all these exercises,
He said that Proteus, your son, was meet;
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
In having known no travel in his youth.
ANTONIO:
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I have consider'd well his loss of time,
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Experience is by industry achiev'd,
And perfected by the swift course of time.
Then tell me whither were I best to send him.
PANTHINO:
I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
Attends the Emperor in his royal court.
ANTONIO:
I know it well.
PANTHINO:
'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
ANTONIO:
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis'd;
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
The execution of it shall make known:
Even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the Emperor's court.
PANTHINO:
To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
With other gentlemen of good esteem
Are journeying to salute the Emperor,
And to commend their service to his will.
ANTONIO:
Good company; with them shall Proteus go.
And- in good time!- now will we break with him.
PROTEUS:
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
O that our fathers would applaud our loves,
To seal our happiness with their consents!
O heavenly Julia!
ANTONIO:
How now! What letter are you reading there?
PROTEUS:
May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
Of commendations sent from Valentine,
Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
ANTONIO:
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
PROTEUS:
There is no news, my lord; but that he writes
How happily he lives, how well-belov'd
And daily graced by the Emperor;
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
ANTONIO:
And how stand you affected to his wish?
PROTEUS:
As one relying on your lordship's will,
And not depending on his friendly wish.
ANTONIO:
My will is something sorted with his wish.
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
For what I will, I will, and there an end.
I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the Emperor's court;
What maintenance he from his friends receives,
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
To-morrow be in readiness to go-
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
PROTEUS:
My lord, I cannot be so soon provided;
Please you, deliberate a day or two.
ANTONIO:
Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee.
No more of stay; to-morrow thou must go.
Come on, Panthino; you shall be employ'd
To hasten on his expedition.
PROTEUS:
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love.
O, how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day,
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
And by an by a cloud takes all away!
PANTHINO:
Sir Proteus, your father calls for you;
He is in haste; therefore, I pray you, go.
PROTEUS:
Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto;
And yet a thousand times it answers 'No.'
SPEED:
Sir, your glove.
VALENTINE:
Not mine: my gloves are on.
SPEED:
Why, then, this may be yours; for this is but one.
VALENTINE:
Ha! let me see; ay, give it me, it's mine;
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah, Silvia! Silvia!
SPEED:
[Calling]
VALENTINE:
How now, sirrah?
SPEED:
She is not within hearing, sir.
VALENTINE:
Why, sir, who bade you call her?
SPEED:
Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
VALENTINE:
Well, you'll still be too forward.
SPEED:
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
VALENTINE:
Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
SPEED:
She that your worship loves?
VALENTINE:
Why, how know you that I am in love?
SPEED:
Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn'd, like
Sir Proteus, to wreath your arms like a malcontent; to relish a
love-song, like a robin redbreast; to walk alone, like one that
had the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had lost his
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears
robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walk'd, to
walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently
after dinner; when you look'd sadly, it was for want of money.
And now you are metamorphis'd with a mistress, that, when I look
on you, I can hardly think you my master.
VALENTINE:
Are all these things perceiv'd in me?
SPEED:
They are all perceiv'd without ye.
VALENTINE:
Without me? They cannot.
SPEED:
Without you! Nay, that's certain; for, without you were so
simple, none else would; but you are so without these follies
that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the
water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady.
VALENTINE:
But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
SPEED:
She that you gaze on so, as she sits at supper?
VALENTINE:
Hast thou observ'd that? Even she, I mean.
SPEED:
Why, sir, I know her not.
VALENTINE:
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know'st
her not?
SPEED:
Is she not hard-favour'd, sir?
VALENTINE:
Not so fair, boy, as well-favour'd.
SPEED:
Sir, I know that well enough.
VALENTINE:
What dost thou know?
SPEED:
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favour'd.
VALENTINE:
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour
infinite.
SPEED:
That's because the one is painted, and the other out of all
count.
VALENTINE:
How painted? and how out of count?
SPEED:
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts
of her beauty.
VALENTINE:
How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.
SPEED:
You never saw her since she was deform'd.
VALENTINE:
How long hath she been deform'd?
SPEED:
Ever since you lov'd her.
VALENTINE:
I have lov'd her ever since I saw her, and still
I see her beautiful.
SPEED:
If you love her, you cannot see her.
VALENTINE:
Why?
SPEED:
Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes; or your own
eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir
Proteus for going ungarter'd!
VALENTINE:
What should I see then?
SPEED:
Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,
being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being
in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
VALENTINE:
Belike, boy, then you are in love; for last morning you
could not see to wipe my shoes.
SPEED:
True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you
swing'd me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you
for yours.
VALENTINE:
In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
SPEED:
I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
VALENTINE:
Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one
she loves.
SPEED:
And have you?
VALENTINE:
I have.
SPEED:
Are they not lamely writ?
VALENTINE:
No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
Peace! here she comes.
SPEED:
[Aside]
Now will he interpret to her.
VALENTINE:
Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.
SPEED:
[Aside]
Here's a million of manners.
SILVIA:
Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
SPEED:
[Aside]
VALENTINE:
As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in,
But for my duty to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I thank you, gentle servant. 'Tis very clerkly done.
VALENTINE:
Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
For, being ignorant to whom it goes,
I writ at random, very doubtfully.
SILVIA:
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
VALENTINE:
No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
Please you command, a thousand times as much;
And yet-
SILVIA:
A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
And yet I will not name it- and yet I care not.
And yet take this again- and yet I thank you-
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
SPEED:
[Aside]
VALENTINE:
What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?
SILVIA:
Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
But, since unwillingly, take them again.
Nay, take them.
VALENTINE:
Madam, they are for you.
SILVIA:
Ay, ay, you writ them, sir, at my request;
But I will none of them; they are for you:
I would have had them writ more movingly.
VALENTINE:
Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
SILVIA:
And when it's writ, for my sake read it over;
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
VALENTINE:
If it please me, madam, what then?
SILVIA:
Why, if it please you, take it for your labour.
And so good morrow, servant.
SPEED:
O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
My master sues to her; and she hath taught her suitor,
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
O excellent device! Was there ever heard a better,
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?
VALENTINE:
How now, sir! What are you reasoning with yourself?
SPEED:
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
VALENTINE:
To do what?
SPEED:
To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia?
VALENTINE:
To whom?
SPEED:
To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.
VALENTINE:
What figure?
SPEED:
By a letter, I should say.
VALENTINE:
Why, she hath not writ to me.
SPEED:
What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself?
Why, do you not perceive the jest?
VALENTINE:
No, believe me.
SPEED:
No believing you indeed, sir. But did you perceive her
earnest?
VALENTINE:
She gave me none except an angry word.
SPEED:
Why, she hath given you a letter.
VALENTINE:
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
SPEED:
And that letter hath she deliver'd, and there an end.
VALENTINE:
I would it were no worse.
SPEED:
I'll warrant you 'tis as well.
'For often have you writ to her; and she, in modesty,
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.'
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you,
sir? 'Tis dinner time.
VALENTINE:
I have din'd.
SPEED:
Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on
the air, I am one that am nourish'd by my victuals, and would
fain have meat. O, be not like your mistress! Be moved, be moved.
PROTEUS:
Have patience, gentle Julia.
JULIA:
I must, where is no remedy.
PROTEUS:
When possibly I can, I will return.
JULIA:
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
PROTEUS:
Why, then, we'll make exchange. Here, take you this.
JULIA:
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
PROTEUS:
Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now- nay, not thy tide of tears:
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell!
What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
PANTHINO:
Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
PROTEUS:
Go; I come, I come.
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
LAUNCE:
Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the
kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv'd my
proportion, like the Prodigious Son, and am going with Sir
Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab my dog be the
sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her
hands, and all our house in a great perplexity; yet did not this
cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pebble
stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have
wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam having no eyes,
look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you
the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is
my father; no, no, left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so
neither; yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This
shoe with the hole in it is my mother, and this my father. A
vengeance on 't! There 'tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister,
for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand;
this hat is Nan our maid; I am the dog; no, the dog is himself,
and I am the dog- O, the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so.
Now come I to my father: 'Father, your blessing.' Now should not
the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father;
well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could
speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her- why there 'tis;
here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister;
mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a
tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my
tears.
PANTHINO:
Launce, away, away, aboard! Thy master is shipp'd, and
thou art to post after with oars. What's the matter? Why weep'st
thou, man? Away, ass! You'll lose the tide if you tarry any
longer.
LAUNCE:
It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
PANTHINO:
What's the unkindest tide?
LAUNCE:
Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
PANTHINO:
Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in losing
the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy
master, and, in losing thy master, lose thy service, and, in
losing thy service- Why dost thou stop my mouth?
LAUNCE:
For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
PANTHINO:
Where should I lose my tongue?
LAUNCE:
In thy tale.
PANTHINO:
In thy tail!
LAUNCE:
Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the
service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able
to fill it with my tears; if the wind were down, I could drive
the boat with my sighs.
PANTHINO:
Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
LAUNCE:
Sir, call me what thou dar'st.
PANTHINO:
Will thou go?
LAUNCE:
Well, I will go.
SILVIA:
Servant!
VALENTINE:
Mistress?
SPEED:
Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
VALENTINE:
Ay, boy, it's for love.
SPEED:
Not of you.
VALENTINE:
Of my mistress, then.
SPEED:
'Twere good you knock'd him.
SILVIA:
Servant, you are sad.
VALENTINE:
Indeed, madam, I seem so.
THURIO:
Seem you that you are not?
VALENTINE:
Haply I do.
THURIO:
So do counterfeits.
VALENTINE:
So do you.
THURIO:
What seem I that I am not?
VALENTINE:
Wise.
THURIO:
What instance of the contrary?
VALENTINE:
Your folly.
THURIO:
And how quote you my folly?
VALENTINE:
I quote it in your jerkin.
THURIO:
My jerkin is a doublet.
VALENTINE:
Well, then, I'll double your folly.
THURIO:
How?
SILVIA:
What, angry, Sir Thurio! Do you change colour?
VALENTINE:
Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
THURIO:
That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
air.
VALENTINE:
You have said, sir.
THURIO:
Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
SILVIA:
A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
VALENTINE:
'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
SILVIA:
Who is that, servant?
VALENTINE:
Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio
borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks, and spends what he
borrows kindly in your company.
THURIO:
Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your
wit bankrupt.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it
appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.
SILVIA:
No more, gentlemen, no more. Here comes my father.
DUKE:
Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
Sir Valentine, your father is in good health.
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?
VALENTINE:
My lord, I will be thankful
To any happy messenger from thence.
DUKE:
Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation,
And not without desert so well reputed.
DUKE:
Hath he not a son?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
The honour and regard of such a father.
DUKE:
You know him well?
VALENTINE:
I knew him as myself; for from our infancy
We have convers'd and spent our hours together;
And though myself have been an idle truant,
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
Made use and fair advantage of his days:
His years but young, but his experience old;
His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
He is complete in feature and in mind,
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
DUKE:
Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
He is as worthy for an empress' love
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me
With commendation from great potentates,
And here he means to spend his time awhile.
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
VALENTINE:
Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
DUKE:
Welcome him, then, according to his worth-
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it.
I will send him hither to you presently.
VALENTINE:
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me but that his mistresss
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
SILVIA:
Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them
Upon some other pawn for fealty.
VALENTINE:
Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
SILVIA:
Nay, then, he should be blind; and, being blind,
How could he see his way to seek out you?
VALENTINE:
Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
THURIO:
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
VALENTINE:
To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself;
Upon a homely object Love can wink.
SILVIA:
Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
VALENTINE:
Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
SILVIA:
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
VALENTINE:
Mistress, it is; sweet lady, entertain him
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
PROTEUS:
Not so, sweet lady; but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
VALENTINE:
Leave off discourse of disability;
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
PROTEUS:
My duty will I boast of, nothing else.
SILVIA:
And duty never yet did want his meed.
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
PROTEUS:
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
SILVIA:
That you are welcome?
PROTEUS:
That you are worthless.
THURIO:
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
SILVIA:
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome.
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
When you have done we look to hear from you.
PROTEUS:
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
VALENTINE:
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
PROTEUS:
Your friends are well, and have them much commended.
VALENTINE:
And how do yours?
PROTEUS:
I left them all in health.
VALENTINE:
How does your lady, and how thrives your love?
PROTEUS:
My tales of love were wont to weary you;
I know you joy not in a love-discourse.
VALENTINE:
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now;
I have done penance for contemning Love,
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs;
For, in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
And hath so humbled me as I confess
There is no woe to his correction,
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep,
Upon the very naked name of love.
PROTEUS:
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Was this the idol that you worship so?
VALENTINE:
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
PROTEUS:
No; but she is an earthly paragon.
VALENTINE:
Call her divine.
PROTEUS:
I will not flatter her.
VALENTINE:
O, flatter me; for love delights in praises!
PROTEUS:
When I was sick you gave me bitter pills,
And I must minister the like to you.
VALENTINE:
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
Yet let her be a principality,
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
PROTEUS:
Except my mistress.
VALENTINE:
Sweet, except not any;
Except thou wilt except against my love.
PROTEUS:
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
VALENTINE:
And I will help thee to prefer her too:
She shall be dignified with this high honour-
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And, of so great a favour growing proud,
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flow'r
And make rough winter everlastingly.
PROTEUS:
Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
VALENTINE:
Pardon me, Proteus; all I can is nothing
To her, whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
She is alone.
PROTEUS:
Then let her alone.
VALENTINE:
Not for the world! Why, man, she is mine own;
And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
My foolish rival, that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge,
Is gone with her along; and I must after,
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
PROTEUS:
But she loves you?
VALENTINE:
Ay, and we are betroth'd; nay more, our marriage-hour,
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
Determin'd of- how I must climb her window,
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
PROTEUS:
Go on before; I shall enquire you forth;
I must unto the road to disembark
Some necessaries that I needs must use;
And then I'll presently attend you.
VALENTINE:
Will you make haste?
PROTEUS:
I will.
Even as one heat another heat expels
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Is it my mind, or Valentinus' praise,
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love-
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
Which like a waxen image 'gainst a fire
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
And that I love him not as I was wont.
O! but I love his lady too too much,
And that's the reason I love him so little.
How shall I dote on her with more advice
That thus without advice begin to love her!
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
But when I look on her perfections,
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
If I can check my erring love, I will;
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
SPEED:
Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Padua.
LAUNCE:
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I
reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hang'd,
nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid, and
the hostess say 'Welcome!'
SPEED:
Come on, you madcap; I'll to the alehouse with you
presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have
five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with
Madam Julia?
LAUNCE:
Marry, after they clos'd in earnest, they parted very
fairly in jest.
SPEED:
But shall she marry him?
LAUNCE:
No.
SPEED:
How then? Shall he marry her?
LAUNCE:
No, neither.
SPEED:
What, are they broken?
LAUNCE:
No, they are both as whole as a fish.
SPEED:
Why then, how stands the matter with them?
LAUNCE:
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well
with her.
SPEED:
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
LAUNCE:
What a block art thou that thou canst not! My staff
understands me.
SPEED:
What thou say'st?
LAUNCE:
Ay, and what I do too; look thee, I'll but lean, and my
staff understands me.
SPEED:
It stands under thee, indeed.
LAUNCE:
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
SPEED:
But tell me true, will't be a match?
LAUNCE:
Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will;
if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
SPEED:
The conclusion is, then, that it will.
LAUNCE:
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a
parable.
SPEED:
'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how say'st thou
that my master is become a notable lover?
LAUNCE:
I never knew him otherwise.
SPEED:
Than how?
LAUNCE:
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
SPEED:
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak'st me.
LAUNCE:
Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.
SPEED:
I tell thee my master is become a hot lover.
LAUNCE:
Why, I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love.
If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an
Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.
SPEED:
Why?
LAUNCE:
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to
the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
SPEED:
At thy service.
PROTEUS:
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
And ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury:
Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn'd,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken;
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit t' exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths!
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose;
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss:
For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend;
For love is still most precious in itself;
And Silvia- witness heaven, that made her fair!-
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Rememb'ring that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
I cannot now prove constant to myself
Without some treachery us'd to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber window,
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
Now presently I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight,
Who, all enrag'd, will banish Valentine,
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift.
JULIA:
Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
And, ev'n in kind love, I do conjure thee,
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly character'd and engrav'd,
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How, with my honour, I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus.
LUCETTA:
Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
JULIA:
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
LUCETTA:
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
JULIA:
O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
Pity the dearth that I have pined in
By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love.
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
LUCETTA:
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
JULIA:
The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.
The current that with gentle murmur glides,
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
But when his fair course is not hindered,
He makes sweet music with th' enamell'd stones,
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
And so by many winding nooks he strays,
With willing sport, to the wild ocean.
Then let me go, and hinder not my course.
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,
And make a pastime of each weary step,
Till the last step have brought me to my love;
And there I'll rest as, after much turmoil,
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
LUCETTA:
But in what habit will you go along?
JULIA:
Not like a woman, for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men;
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
As may beseem some well-reputed page.
LUCETTA:
Why then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
JULIA:
No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots-
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be.
LUCETTA:
What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?
JULIA:
That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
What compass will you wear your farthingale.'
Why ev'n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.
LUCETTA:
You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
JULIA:
Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favour'd.
LUCETTA:
A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
JULIA:
Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have
What thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me it will make me scandaliz'd.
LUCETTA:
If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
JULIA:
Nay, that I will not.
LUCETTA:
Then never dream on infamy, but go.
If Proteus like your journey when you come,
No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone.
I fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withal.
JULIA:
That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
And instances of infinite of love,
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
LUCETTA:
All these are servants to deceitful men.
JULIA:
Base men that use them to so base effect!
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth;
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
LUCETTA:
Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him.
JULIA:
Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong
To bear a hard opinion of his truth;
Only deserve my love by loving him.
And presently go with me to my chamber,
To take a note of what I stand in need of
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Come, answer not, but to it presently;
I am impatient of my tarriance.
DUKE:
Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
We have some secrets to confer about.
Now tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
PROTEUS:
My gracious lord, that which I would discover
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
But, when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
This night intends to steal away your daughter;
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determin'd to bestow her
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
It would be much vexation to your age.
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
DUKE:
Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court;
But, fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so, unworthily, disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me.
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tow'r,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
PROTEUS:
Know, noble lord, they have devis'd a mean
How he her chamber window will ascend
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
For which the youthful lover now is gone,
And this way comes he with it presently;
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
That my discovery be not aimed at;
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
DUKE:
Upon mine honour, he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this.
PROTEUS:
Adieu, my lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
DUKE:
Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
VALENTINE:
Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
And I am going to deliver them.
DUKE:
Be they of much import?
VALENTINE:
The tenour of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court.
DUKE:
Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
VALENTINE:
I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?
DUKE:
No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty,
I now am full resolv'd to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in.
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow'r;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.
VALENTINE:
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
DUKE:
There is a lady, in Verona here,
Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,
And nought esteems my aged eloquence.
Now, therefore, would I have thee to my tutor-
For long agone I have forgot to court;
Besides, the fashion of the time is chang'd-
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
VALENTINE:
Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
DUKE:
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
VALENTINE:
A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
Send her another; never give her o'er,
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
But rather to beget more love in you;
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,
For why, the fools are mad if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
For 'Get you gone' she doth not mean 'Away!'
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
DUKE:
But she I mean is promis'd by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth;
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her.
VALENTINE:
Why then I would resort to her by night.
DUKE:
Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night.
VALENTINE:
What lets but one may enter at her window?
DUKE:
Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life.
VALENTINE:
Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Would serve to scale another Hero's tow'r,
So bold Leander would adventure it.
DUKE:
Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
VALENTINE:
When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.
DUKE:
This very night; for Love is like a child,
That longs for everything that he can come by.
VALENTINE:
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
DUKE:
But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
VALENTINE:
It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length.
DUKE:
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
VALENTINE:
Ay, my good lord.
DUKE:
Then let me see thy cloak.
I'll get me one of such another length.
VALENTINE:
Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
DUKE:
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding!
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
What's here?
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaethon- for thou art Merops' son-
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder, over-weening slave,
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates;
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence.
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which, all too much, I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone; I will not hear thy vain excuse,
But, as thou lov'st thy life, make speed from hence.
VALENTINE:
And why not death rather than living torment?
To die is to be banish'd from myself,
And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
Unless it be to think that she is by,
And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
There is no music in the nightingale;
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
There is no day for me to look upon.
She is my essence, and I leave to be
If I be not by her fair influence
Foster'd, illumin'd, cherish'd, kept alive.
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
Tarry I here, I but attend on death;
But fly I hence, I fly away from life.
PROTEUS:
Run, boy, run, run, seek him out.
LAUNCE:
So-ho, so-ho!
PROTEUS:
What seest thou?
LAUNCE:
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on 's head but 'tis a
Valentine.
PROTEUS:
Valentine?
VALENTINE:
No.
PROTEUS:
Who then? his spirit?
VALENTINE:
Neither.
PROTEUS:
What then?
VALENTINE:
Nothing.
LAUNCE:
Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
PROTEUS:
Who wouldst thou strike?
LAUNCE:
Nothing.
PROTEUS:
Villain, forbear.
LAUNCE:
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing. I pray you-
PROTEUS:
Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
VALENTINE:
My ears are stopp'd and cannot hear good news,
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
PROTEUS:
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.
VALENTINE:
Is Silvia dead?
PROTEUS:
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
Hath she forsworn me?
PROTEUS:
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
What is your news?
LAUNCE:
Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
PROTEUS:
That thou art banished- O, that's the news!-
From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.
VALENTINE:
O, I have fed upon this woe already,
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
PROTEUS:
Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom-
Which, unrevers'd, stands in effectual force-
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
With them, upon her knees, her humble self,
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
As if but now they waxed pale for woe.
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire-
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
Besides, her intercession chaf'd him so,
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
That to close prison he commanded her,
With many bitter threats of biding there.
VALENTINE:
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
Have some malignant power upon my life:
If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
PROTEUS:
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
And study help for that which thou lament'st.
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love;
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that,
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
The time now serves not to expostulate.
Come, I'll convey thee through the city gate;
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
Of all that may concern thy love affairs.
As thou lov'st Silvia, though not for thyself,
Regard thy danger, and along with me.
VALENTINE:
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate.
PROTEUS:
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
VALENTINE:
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
LAUNCE:
I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think
my master is a kind of a knave; but that's all one if he be but
one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love; yet I am
in love; but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor
who 'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman I will not
tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet 'tis not a maid, for
she hath had gossips; yet 'tis a maid, for she is her master's
maid and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a
water-spaniel- which is much in a bare Christian. Here is the
cate-log of her condition. 'Inprimis: She
can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse
cannot fetch, but only carry; therefore is she better than a
jade. 'Item: She can milk.' Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
with clean hands.
SPEED:
How now, Signior Launce! What news with your mastership?
LAUNCE:
With my master's ship? Why, it is at sea.
SPEED:
Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news,
then, in your paper?
LAUNCE:
The black'st news that ever thou heard'st.
SPEED:
Why, man? how black?
LAUNCE:
Why, as black as ink.
SPEED:
Let me read them.
LAUNCE:
Fie on thee, jolt-head; thou canst not read.
SPEED:
Thou liest; I can.
LAUNCE:
I will try thee. Tell me this: Who begot thee?
SPEED:
Marry, the son of my grandfather.
LAUNCE:
O illiterate loiterer. It was the son of thy grandmother.
This proves that thou canst not read.
SPEED:
Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
LAUNCE:
[Handing over the paper]
speed.
SPEED:
[Reads]
LAUNCE:
Ay, that she can.
SPEED:
'Item: She brews good ale.'
LAUNCE:
And thereof comes the proverb: Blessing of your heart, you
brew good ale.
SPEED:
'Item: She can sew.'
LAUNCE:
That's as much as to say 'Can she so?'
SPEED:
'Item: She can knit.'
LAUNCE:
What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can
knit him a stock.
SPEED:
'Item: She can wash and scour.'
LAUNCE:
A special virtue; for then she need not be wash'd and
scour'd.
SPEED:
'Item: She can spin.'
LAUNCE:
Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for
her living.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
LAUNCE:
That's as much as to say 'bastard virtues'; that indeed
know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.
SPEED:
'Here follow her vices.'
LAUNCE:
Close at the heels of her virtues.
SPEED:
'Item: She is not to be kiss'd fasting, in respect of her
breath.'
LAUNCE:
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.
Read on.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
LAUNCE:
That makes amends for her sour breath.
SPEED:
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
LAUNCE:
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
SPEED:
'Item: She is slow in words.'
LAUNCE:
O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow
in words is a woman's only virtue. I pray thee, out with't; and
place it for her chief virtue.
SPEED:
'Item: She is proud.'
LAUNCE:
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot be ta'en
from her.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath no teeth.'
LAUNCE:
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
SPEED:
'Item: She is curst.'
LAUNCE:
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
SPEED:
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
LAUNCE:
If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will;
for good things should be praised.
SPEED:
'Item: She is too liberal.'
LAUNCE:
Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she is slow
of; of her purse she shall not, for that I'll keep shut. Now of
another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE:
Stop there; I'll have her; she was mine, and not mine,
twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.
SPEED:
'Item: She hath more hair than wit'-
LAUNCE:
More hair than wit. It may be; I'll prove it: the cover of
the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt;
the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the
greater hides the less. What's next?
SPEED:
'And more faults than hairs'-
LAUNCE:
That's monstrous. O that that were out!
SPEED:
'And more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE:
Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I'll have
her; an if it be a match, as nothing is impossible-
SPEED:
What then?
LAUNCE:
Why, then will I tell thee- that thy master stays for thee
at the Northgate.
SPEED:
For me?
LAUNCE:
For thee! ay, who art thou? He hath stay'd for a better man
than thee.
SPEED:
And must I go to him?
LAUNCE:
Thou must run to him, for thou hast stay'd so long that
going will scarce serve the turn.
SPEED:
Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!
LAUNCE:
Now will he be swing'd for reading my letter. An unmannerly
slave that will thrust himself into secrets! I'll after, to
rejoice in the boy's correction.
DUKE:
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
THURIO:
Since his exile she hath despis'd me most,
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
That I am desperate of obtaining her.
DUKE:
This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman,
According to our proclamation, gone?
PROTEUS:
Gone, my good lord.
DUKE:
My daughter takes his going grievously.
PROTEUS:
A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
DUKE:
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee-
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert-
Makes me the better to confer with thee.
PROTEUS:
Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
Let me not live to look upon your Grace.
DUKE:
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
PROTEUS:
I do, my lord.
DUKE:
And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will.
PROTEUS:
She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
DUKE:
Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?
PROTEUS:
The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent-
Three things that women highly hold in hate.
DUKE:
Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
PROTEUS:
Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
DUKE:
Then you must undertake to slander him.
PROTEUS:
And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
Especially against his very friend.
DUKE:
Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Your slander never can endamage him;
Therefore the office is indifferent,
Being entreated to it by your friend.
PROTEUS:
You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
She shall not long continue love to him.
But say this weed her love from Valentine,
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
THURIO:
Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
You must provide to bottom it on me;
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
DUKE:
And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
You are already Love's firm votary
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large-
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you-
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
PROTEUS:
As much as I can do I will effect.
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
DUKE:
Ay,
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
PROTEUS:
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
That may discover such integrity;
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Visit by night your lady's chamber window
With some sweet consort; to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump- the night's dead silence
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
DUKE:
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
THURIO:
And thy advice this night I'll put in practice;
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
Let us into the city presently
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice.
DUKE:
About it, gentlemen!
PROTEUS:
We'll wait upon your Grace till after supper,
And afterward determine our proceedings.
DUKE:
Even now about it! I will pardon you.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
SECOND OUTLAW:
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
THIRD OUTLAW:
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye;
If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you.
SPEED:
Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
That all the travellers do fear so much.
VALENTINE:
My friends-
FIRST OUTLAW:
That's not so, sir; we are your enemies.
SECOND OUTLAW:
Peace! we'll hear him.
THIRD OUTLAW:
Ay, by my beard, will we; for he is a proper man.
VALENTINE:
Then know that I have little wealth to lose;
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
My riches are these poor habiliments,
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
You take the sum and substance that I have.
SECOND OUTLAW:
Whither travel you?
VALENTINE:
To Verona.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Whence came you?
VALENTINE:
From Milan.
THIRD OUTLAW:
Have you long sojourn'd there?
VALENTINE:
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
FIRST OUTLAW:
What, were you banish'd thence?
VALENTINE:
I was.
SECOND OUTLAW:
For what offence?
VALENTINE:
For that which now torments me to rehearse:
I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
Without false vantage or base treachery.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
VALENTINE:
I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
SECOND OUTLAW:
Have you the tongues?
VALENTINE:
My youthful travel therein made me happy,
Or else I often had been miserable.
THIRD OUTLAW:
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
FIRST OUTLAW:
We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
SPEED:
Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
VALENTINE:
Peace, villain!
SECOND OUTLAW:
Tell us this: have you anything to take to?
VALENTINE:
Nothing but my fortune.
THIRD OUTLAW:
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Thrust from the company of awful men;
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.
SECOND OUTLAW:
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
FIRST OUTLAW:
And I for such-like petty crimes as these.
But to the purpose- for we cite our faults
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
And, partly, seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape, and by your own report
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want-
SECOND OUTLAW:
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.
Are you content to be our general-
To make a virtue of necessity,
And live as we do in this wilderness?
THIRD OUTLAW:
What say'st thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
Say 'ay' and be the captain of us all.
We'll do thee homage, and be rul'd by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.
FIRST OUTLAW:
But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest.
SECOND OUTLAW:
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
VALENTINE:
I take your offer, and will live with you,
Provided that you do no outrages
On silly women or poor passengers.
THIRD OUTLAW:
No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us; we'll bring thee to our crews,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
PROTEUS:
Already have I been false to Valentine,
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
Under the colour of commending him
I have access my own love to prefer;
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
When I protest true loyalty to her,
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
When to her beauty I commend my vows,
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd;
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her window,
And give some evening music to her ear.
THURIO:
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
PROTEUS:
Ay, gentle Thurio; for you know that love
Will creep in service where it cannot go.
THURIO:
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
PROTEUS:
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
THURIO:
Who? Silvia?
PROTEUS:
Ay, Silvia- for your sake.
THURIO:
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
Enter at a distance, HOST, and JULIA in boy's clothes
HOST:
Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly; I pray you,
why is it?
JULIA:
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
HOST:
Come, we'll have you merry; I'll bring you where you shall
hear music, and see the gentleman that you ask'd for.
JULIA:
But shall I hear him speak?
HOST:
Ay, that you shall.
JULIA:
That will be music.
HOST:
Hark, hark!
JULIA:
Is he among these?
HOST:
Ay; but peace! let's hear 'em.
HOST:
How now, are you sadder than you were before?
How do you, man? The music likes you not.
JULIA:
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
HOST:
Why, my pretty youth?
JULIA:
He plays false, father.
HOST:
How, out of tune on the strings?
JULIA:
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
heart-strings.
HOST:
You have a quick ear.
JULIA:
Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
HOST:
I perceive you delight not in music.
JULIA:
Not a whit, when it jars so.
HOST:
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
JULIA:
Ay, that change is the spite.
HOST:
You would have them always play but one thing?
JULIA:
I would always have one play but one thing.
But, Host, doth this Sir Proteus, that we talk on,
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
HOST:
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov'd her out of
all nick.
JULIA:
Where is Launce?
HOST:
Gone to seek his dog, which to-morrow, by his master's
command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
JULIA:
Peace, stand aside; the company parts.
PROTEUS:
Sir Thurio, fear not you; I will so plead
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
THURIO:
Where meet we?
PROTEUS:
At Saint Gregory's well.
THURIO:
Farewell.
PROTEUS:
Madam, good ev'n to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?
PROTEUS:
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
SILVIA:
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
PROTEUS:
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
SILVIA:
What's your will?
PROTEUS:
That I may compass yours.
SILVIA:
You have your wish; my will is even this,
That presently you hie you home to bed.
Thou subtle, perjur'd, false, disloyal man,
Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
To be seduced by thy flattery
That hast deceiv'd so many with thy vows?
Return, return, and make thy love amends.
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
I am so far from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
PROTEUS:
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
But she is dead.
JULIA:
[Aside]
For I am sure she is not buried.
SILVIA:
Say that she be; yet Valentine, thy friend,
Survives, to whom, thyself art witness,
I am betroth'd; and art thou not asham'd
To wrong him with thy importunacy?
PROTEUS:
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
SILVIA:
And so suppose am I; for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried.
PROTEUS:
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
SILVIA:
Go to thy lady's grave, and call hers thence;
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
JULIA:
[Aside]
PROTEUS:
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep;
For, since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
And to your shadow will I make true love.
JULIA:
[Aside]
And make it but a shadow, as I am.
SILVIA:
I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
Send to me in the morning, and I'll send it;
And so, good rest.
PROTEUS:
As wretches have o'ernight
That wait for execution in the morn.
JULIA:
Host, will you go?
HOST:
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
JULIA:
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
HOST:
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.
JULIA:
Not so; but it hath been the longest night
That e'er I watch'd, and the most heaviest.
EGLAMOUR:
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind;
There's some great matter she'd employ me in.
Madam, madam!
SILVIA:
Who calls?
EGLAMOUR:
Your servant and your friend;
One that attends your ladyship's command.
SILVIA:
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow!
EGLAMOUR:
As many, worthy lady, to yourself!
According to your ladyship's impose,
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in.
SILVIA:
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not-
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd.
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine;
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
Thyself hast lov'd; and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died,
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
I do desire thy worthy company,
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
And on the justice of my flying hence
To keep me from a most unholy match,
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
I do desire thee, even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
To bear me company and go with me;
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
That I may venture to depart alone.
EGLAMOUR:
Madam, I pity much your grievances;
Which since I know they virtuously are plac'd,
I give consent to go along with you,
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go?
SILVIA:
This evening coming.
EGLAMOUR:
Where shall I meet you?
SILVIA:
At Friar Patrick's cell,
Where I intend holy confession.
EGLAMOUR:
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
SILVIA:
Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
LAUNCE:
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,
it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd
from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and
sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say
precisely 'Thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him
as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no
sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher
and steals her capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur
cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should
say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it
were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to
take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been
hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had suffer'd for't. You shall
judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been
there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says
another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the
Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it
was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs.
'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I'
quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the
thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of
the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay,
I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath
stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the
pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had suffer'd
for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick
you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid
thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave
up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?
Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?
PROTEUS:
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well,
And will employ thee in some service presently.
JULIA:
In what you please; I'll do what I can.
PROTEUS:
.I hope thou wilt. How now, you whoreson
Where have you been these two days loitering?
LAUNCE:
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
PROTEUS:
And what says she to my little jewel?
LAUNCE:
Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish
thanks is good enough for such a present.
PROTEUS:
But she receiv'd my dog?
LAUNCE:
No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back
again.
PROTEUS:
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
LAUNCE:
Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the
hangman's boys in the market-place; and then I offer'd her mine
own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift
the greater.
PROTEUS:
Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,
Or ne'er return again into my sight.
Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!
Sebastian, I have entertained thee
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business,
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth;
Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee.
Go presently, and take this ring with thee,
Deliver it to Madam Silvia-
She lov'd me well deliver'd it to me.
JULIA:
It seems you lov'd not her, to leave her token.
She is dead, belike?
PROTEUS:
Not so; I think she lives.
JULIA:
Alas!
PROTEUS:
Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?
JULIA:
I cannot choose
But pity her.
PROTEUS:
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
JULIA:
Because methinks that she lov'd you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia.
She dreams on him that has forgot her love:
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
And thinking on it makes me cry 'Alas!'
PROTEUS:
Well, give her that ring, and therewithal
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.
JULIA:
How many women would do such a message?
Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Because I love him, I must pity him.
This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,
To bind him to remember my good will;
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
To carry that which I would have refus'd,
To praise his faith, which I would have disprais'd.
I am my master's true confirmed love,
But cannot be true servant to my master
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
SILVIA:
What would you with her, if that I be she?
JULIA:
If you be she, I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
SILVIA:
From whom?
JULIA:
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
SILVIA:
O, he sends you for a picture?
JULIA:
Ay, madam.
SILVIA:
Ursula, bring my picture there.
Go, give your master this. Tell him from me,
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
JULIA:
Madam, please you peruse this letter.
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvis'd
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not.
This is the letter to your ladyship.
SILVIA:
I pray thee let me look on that again.
JULIA:
It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
SILVIA:
There, hold!
I will not look upon your master's lines.
I know they are stuff'd with protestations,
And full of new-found oaths, which he wul break
As easily as I do tear his paper.
JULIA:
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
SILVIA:
The more shame for him that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profan'd the ring,
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
JULIA:
She thanks you.
SILVIA:
What say'st thou?
JULIA:
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.
SILVIA:
Dost thou know her?
JULIA:
Almost as well as I do know myself.
To think upon her woes, I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times.
SILVIA:
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
JULIA:
I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.
SILVIA:
Is she not passing fair?
JULIA:
She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.
When she did think my master lov'd her well,
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
That now she is become as black as I.
SILVIA:
How tall was she?
JULIA:
About my stature; for at Pentecost,
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown;
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
As if the garment had been made for me;
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep a good,
For I did play a lamentable part.
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.
SILVIA:
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself, to think upon thy words.
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.
Farewell.
JULIA:
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
Here is her picture; let me see. I think,
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers;
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow;
If that be all the difference in his love,
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine;
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself,
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, lov'd, and ador'd!
And were there sense in his idolatry
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
That us'd me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,
To make my master out of love with thee.
EGLAMOUR:
The sun begins to gild the western sky,
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia at Friar Patrick's cell should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours
Unless it be to come before their time,
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes. Lady, a happy evening!
SILVIA:
Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey wall;
I fear I am attended by some spies.
EGLAMOUR:
Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.
THURIO:
Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
PROTEUS:
O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
THURIO:
What, that my leg is too long?
PROTEUS:
No; that it is too little.
THURIO:
I'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder.
JULIA:
[Aside]
THURIO:
What says she to my face?
PROTEUS:
She says it is a fair one.
THURIO:
Nay, then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
PROTEUS:
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is:
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
JULIA:
[Aside]
For I had rather wink than look on them.
THURIO:
How likes she my discourse?
PROTEUS:
Ill, when you talk of war.
THURIO:
But well when I discourse of love and peace?
JULIA:
[Aside]
THURIO:
What says she to my valour?
PROTEUS:
O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
JULIA:
[Aside]
THURIO:
What says she to my birth?
PROTEUS:
That you are well deriv'd.
JULIA:
[Aside]
THURIO:
Considers she my possessions?
PROTEUS:
O, ay; and pities them.
THURIO:
Wherefore?
JULIA:
[Aside]
PROTEUS:
That they are out by lease.
JULIA:
Here comes the Duke.
DUKE:
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
THURIO:
Not I.
PROTEUS:
Nor I.
DUKE:
Saw you my daughter?
PROTEUS:
Neither.
DUKE:
Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not.
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence;
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently, and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
THURIO:
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
I'll after, more to be reveng'd on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
PROTEUS:
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour, that goes with her.
JULIA:
And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Come, come.
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
SILVIA:
A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
SECOND OUTLAW:
Come, bring her away.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
SECOND OUTLAW:
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain; we'll follow him that's fled.
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
FIRST OUTLAW:
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave;
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.
SILVIA:
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
VALENTINE:
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns.
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
And leave no memory of what it was!
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia:
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
They love me well; yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
Withdraw thee, Valentine. Who's this comes here?
PROTEUS:
Madam, this service I have done for you,
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
To hazard life, and rescue you from him
That would have forc'd your honour and your love.
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
VALENTINE:
[Aside]
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
SILVIA:
O miserable, unhappy that I am!
PROTEUS:
Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
But by my coming I have made you happy.
SILVIA:
By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy.
JULIA:
[Aside]
SILVIA:
Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
I would have been a breakfast to the beast
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
O, heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
I do detest false, perjur'd Proteus.
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
PROTEUS:
What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
Would I not undergo for one calm look?
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approv'd,
When women cannot love where they're belov'd!
SILVIA:
When Proteus cannot love where he's belov'd!
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
Descended into perjury, to love me.
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,
And that's far worse than none; better have none
Than plural faith, which is too much by one.
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
PROTEUS:
In love,
Who respects friend?
SILVIA:
All men but Proteus.
PROTEUS:
Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
Can no way change you to a milder form,
I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
And love you 'gainst the nature of love- force ye.
SILVIA:
O heaven!
PROTEUS:
I'll force thee yield to my desire.
VALENTINE:
Ruffian! let go that rude uncivil touch;
Thou friend of an ill fashion!
PROTEUS:
Valentine!
VALENTINE:
Thou common friend, that's without faith or love-
For such is a friend now; treacherous man,
Thou hast beguil'd my hopes; nought but mine eye
Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say
I have one friend alive: thou wouldst disprove me.
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
The private wound is deepest. O time most accurst!
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
PROTEUS:
My shame and guilt confounds me.
Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
As e'er I did commit.
VALENTINE:
Then I am paid;
And once again I do receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleas'd;
By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeas'd.
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
JULIA:
O me unhappy!
PROTEUS:
Look to the boy.
VALENTINE:
Why, boy! why, wag! how now!
What's the matter? Look up; speak.
JULIA:
O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam
Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
PROTEUS:
Where is that ring, boy?
JULIA:
Here 'tis; this is it.
PROTEUS:
How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
JULIA:
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
PROTEUS:
But how cam'st thou by this ring?
At my depart I gave this unto Julia.
JULIA:
And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself have brought it hither.
PROTEUS:
How! Julia!
JULIA:
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment- if shame live
In a disguise of love.
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
PROTEUS:
Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man
But constant, he were perfect! That one error
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th' sins:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
What is in Silvia's face but I may spy
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
VALENTINE:
Come, come, a hand from either.
Let me be blest to make this happy close;
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
PROTEUS:
Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.
JULIA:
And I mine.
OUTLAW:
A prize, a prize, a prize!
VALENTINE:
Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd,
Banished Valentine.
DUKE:
Sir Valentine!
THURIO:
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
VALENTINE:
Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
Come not within the measure of my wrath;
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands
Take but possession of her with a touch-
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
THURIO:
Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
His body for a girl that loves him not.
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
DUKE:
The more degenerate and base art thou
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman, and well deriv'd;
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv'd her.
VALENTINE:
I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.
DUKE:
I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.
VALENTINE:
These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,
Are men endu'd with worthy qualities;
Forgive them what they have committed here,
And let them be recall'd from their exile:
They are reformed, civil, full of good,
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
DUKE:
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Come, let us go; we will include all jars
With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.
VALENTINE:
And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.
What think you of this page, my lord?
DUKE:
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
VALENTINE:
I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.
DUKE:
What mean you by that saying?
VALENTINE:
Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear
The story of your loves discovered.
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness!
ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the
like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see,
as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your
Sicilia.
CAMILLO:
I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to
pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed-
CAMILLO:
Beseech you-
ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we
cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to
say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses,
unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot
praise us, as little accuse us.
CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were
train'd together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt
them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now.
Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters, though not
personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts,
letters, loving embassies; that they have seem'd to be together,
though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac'd as it
were from the end
