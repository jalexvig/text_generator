## Shakespeare generator

To generate text in the style of Shakespeare, make sure all dependencies are installed and execute the text_generator.py file.

Execute the text_generator.py script by entering `python text_generator.py` on the commandline. This will begin training. By changing the `generate` keyword argument to `True` at the end of the file, you can generate new text after training!
